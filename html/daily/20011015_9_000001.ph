Wow: The FBI believes that 11 of the <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/waronterrorism/story/0,1373,573707,00.html">hijackers didn't know it was a suicide mission</a>.

There is a lot of propaganda out there. I have heard it said on TV (and the web) that our involvement with Israel has nothing to do with this. <a href="http://www.forward.com/issues/2001/01.10.05/ed.html">I find that hard to understand.</a> I'm not saying that we should change our policies there, but I don't know why we're pretending that it has nothing to do with it.

<a href="http://www.twf.org/News/Y2001/0815-GandhiZionism.html">Ghandi's thoughts on the formation of Israel.</a>

After I posted the Ghandi link, I felt like I should label it as coming from a pro-Islam (maybe anti-anti-Islam?) site. Should I also feel the need to label the link from the Observer as <font size="-1
"><b>[UK "special relationship"]</b></font> and the link from The Forward as <font size="-1"><b>[Jewish conservative]</b></font>? Hmmm. I'll leave it to you to decide who you want to believe.
