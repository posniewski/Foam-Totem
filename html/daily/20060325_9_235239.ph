Looking at the scores, no one liked this movie. I did, though, at least as a rental. It's highly stylized, violent, sometimes funny, and a bit weird. None of the characters except for Domino herself are much more than a paper cutout, but I think they are all meant to be that way. Quite literally, it's her story.

Worth a rent.
