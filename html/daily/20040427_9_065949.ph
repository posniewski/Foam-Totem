Tonight at 9pm PDT, City of Heroes officially goes live.

We've been in "head start" since Sunday (people who pre-ordered can play). It's been going great. We had a hiccup at the very beginning when the login server (not Cryptic code) got tangled up and ran slowly. After a restart, it's been smooth sailing. For those who don't know, such a smooth start is remarkable in this industry.
