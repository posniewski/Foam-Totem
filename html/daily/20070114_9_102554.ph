<a href="http://www.spaceweather.com/">Comet McNaught is visible in daylight right now.</a> This is the brightest comet in 30 years.

Go outside and stand in the shadow of a building. Face south. The comet lies 5 degrees to the left of the sun. (Five degrees is the width of your fist held at arm's length.)
