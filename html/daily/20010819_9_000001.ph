<a href="/postcards">Postcards!</a> The postcard page has about ten new cards posted to it: more from Mess' stadium tour, a naked man french kissing a pig, a jackalope (a cousin to the <A href="http://www.foamtotem.org/random/1996.html">1996 Freak Show</a> vorpal bunny), a Metropoloid waitress, and much, much more!

For those of you into the retro/lounge/cocktail music scene, check out KANU's <a href="http://www.ukans.edu/cwis/units/kanufm/public_html/retro.html">Retro Cocktail Hour</a>. Each show is about 50% hideous (some of you may think it's 100% hideous). Programs are archived for your pleasure.
