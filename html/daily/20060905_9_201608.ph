<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5314592.stm">The recent CO<sub>2</sub> increase is unprecedented over last 800,000 years.</a> Many years ago, I wondered if "global warming" wasn't part of a very long term cycle of the planet. Recently,  data have been collected indicating that it's not part of a cycle shorter than (as of the above article) 800,000 years. That's long enough for me to say that it's a bad thing for civilization.

The data further show that CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature increase together.

I would love to see a graph of the data they've collected.
