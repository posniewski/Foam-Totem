    "content":"\nIt started almost as a joke, I think. I was planning on taking some time off from work, someone said \"Hey, why don't we climb Kilimanjaro?\", and I said yes without hesitation. Or even thinking about it. It seems I make potentially life-changing decisions without much consideration. I'm pretty sure I decided to make the jump to Silicon Valley in the same way. Buying a car, on the other hand, can take a decade. What to have for lunch lies somewhere in between.\n\nSo early this year, several of us decided that we actually would hike Kilimanjaro. I invited my Craig and my Dad, both of whom (and Craig's Dad) decided that they were also crazy enough to do it. All together there would be eight of us who would go on the trek: Dan (friend from college), Kat (roommate), Jenn and Chris (friends for many years, married), Craig (best friend) and his Dad, and me and my Dad.\n\nJenn stepped up and became the main contact and point-person for the whole thing. (Never-ending gratitude and thanks go to Jenn.) We started looking for a trekking company and after a not-insubstantial search found <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ahsantetours.com\/\">Ahsante Tours<\/a>. Other tour places (including ones that came highly rated) seemed to have a difficult time returning our calls and emails, which was not confidence-inspiring. Ahsante was much more helpful and interactive. We also liked that they are a local business in Moshi, Tanzania (rather than a foreign-run company) as well as members of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiliporters.org\/\">KPAP (Kilimanjaro Porter Assistance Project)<\/a> (which sets minimum standards for treatment of porters). Overall, we were very happy with Ahsante both before and during our trip. I recommend them.\n\nThere was one particular guidebook which I recommend highly: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kilimanjaro-trekking-Africas-highest-mountain\/dp\/1905864248\">Kilimanjaro: The Trekking Guide to Africa's Highest Mountain<\/a>, by Henry Steadman. On the whole, his advice was pretty good and largely accurate. The maps provided for the various routes are cleverly constructed and easy to read.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/kili\/ahsante-board.jpg\"><img class=\"posterous\" src=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/kili\/ahsante-board-thumb.jpg\" \/><\/a>\n<center><i>Ahsante's office with the week's treks. We're Tuesday (\"Jenn Group x8\")<\/i><\/center>\n\nAfter much research and discussion, we decided on a seven day trek via the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.climbingkilimanjaro.com\/machame-route-kilimanjaro.php\">Machame route<\/a>. This is supposedly the most interesting route to hike and also provides very good acclimatization for the summit. The success rate for Machame is better than other routes. You can do this route in six days, but we inserted an extra day at Karanga camp (between Barranco and Barafu). I'll spoil the surprise now and say that I am very happy that we put this extra day in and at this location.\n\nWe targeted late August\/early September for the trip. Once we jiggled everyone's calendar, we ended up leaving the U.S. on 2 Sep. We gave an extra empty day before the trek started to give travel some slack, seven days for the trek, another rest day, five days of safari, and a last day to begin travel home. We decided that it would be silly to go to Africa and NOT do a safari, so we added a five-day safari on as a sort of \"prize\" for finishing the trek. (Craig and his Dad returned after the trek, because Craig wanted to get home for his son's birthday.)\n\nAll the plans in place, we started getting airline tickets to Kilimanjaro airport. The only big airline to fly there is KLM, via Amsterdam. So, my flights were SFO to Amsterdam, and then to Kilimanjaro, which was pretty easy (though it is a long pair of flights). We had a variety of problems with KLM. We bought upgraded (Economy Comfort) seats and found that they would vanish out from underneath us. This actually happened to me for my return flights while I was in Africa, which was vexing. But KLM is the only game in town. Even if you get everything squared away in advance it may change without you being notified. My advice is to be vigilant. \n\n<img class=\"posterous\" src=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/kili\/chris-100.jpg\" \/>\n<center><i>Chris finished his 100th mile this summer.<\/i><\/center>\n\nAnd thus began a summer of gear testing and fitness improvement. I hiked practically every week with Craig and his son, Chris. We tested boots, packs, socks, liners, shirts, pants, nutrition, and so on. We also know several of the trails by heart now. In addition, I had been and continued to run. I logged 450+ miles running and around 100 miles hiking over the spring and summer. So, I was in pretty good shape. Others mainly did a bunch of hiking to get used to being on their feet for so long (and test their gear, break in boots, etc). I was at REI twice a week for two months. They're probably wondering if I got hit by a bus since I haven't been around.\n\nWe collated several different gear lists from Steadman, online, my friend Matt(who had done Kili a couple years ago), and Dan (who has more experience with cold camping than the rest of us). <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheet\/ccc?key=0AnhfrZwev-OHdHBWUjlGNndCVEtaelFJZ050WEIwUkE&hl=en_US#gid=3\">Here's my gear list<\/a>, with post-trek comments regarding how the items worked out.\n\nThe tour company were to provide tents, and we decided that we would rent sleeping bags and sleeping pads from them as well. This kept us from having to lug these bulkier items around the world. It also meant that I didn't need to buy a 10 degree bag I'm never going to use again. This worked out very well, I think. The equipment was in fantastic (nearly new, I'd say) condition (as were the tents).\n\nAnd suddenly it was two weeks before leaving. I had done a pretty good job of not thinking about how crazy the whole idea was, or the fact I was going to Africa, or any of the scarier or more exciting things. But now it could not be denied: I was going to Tanzania with whatever was in my bags for around three weeks. What was I thinking?!\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/kili\/kilipacking.jpg\"><img class=\"posterous\" src=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/kili\/kilipacking-thumb.jpg\" \/><\/a>\n<center><i>All my gear laid out and ready to go.
