Chosen for its fairly high score (for a horror flick) from Rotten Tomatoes. Not indicative of quality in this case. Extended suburban family gets waylaid in the Nevada desert and is tormented by mutants created by 1950s nuclear tests. Even without the mutants trying to shoot, immolate, rape, and eat the family, they were doomed to perish from stupidity/exposure. By the second minute of the movie (post-teaser) you already want main protagonist to be the first one to go. The fact that he lives is rather a let-down, actually. Best moments in the movie happen in the teaser before the title credits roll. Weak.
