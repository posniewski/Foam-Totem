    "content":"Started playing <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rockstargames.com\/lanoire\">L.A. Noire<\/a> last night. I don't entirely hate it yet.\n\nI think the Truth\/Doubt\/Lie mechanic is deeply flawed. You either choose the right answer or you simply fail. There's no undo, no reload, nor any way to re-do the interrogation or even try to bring the conversation around again. Worse, when the actor says something entirely truthful, you still must \"doubt\" sometimes to pump them for more information. So, I feel like I'm playing a guessing game with the designer rather than really interrogating the witness, which pulls me way out of the experience.\n\n(Reminds me of the Bethesda games where it has several choices for what to say, and then the character says something entirely different. It's vexing; they need to stop doing that.)",
