Let me rail briefly on a literary mechanic which drives me mad:<br>
Why must authors have the protagonist do things which are plainly stupid? I understand the device. One can use it to create tension; we can perhaps see the upcoming problem but the narrator does not. When done well, the stupidity isn't obvious to the protagonist. It is obvious to us because we are observers.

But when the protagonist ought to know better given his experience thus far and the character that they are, it sets off my "inconsistent world" alarm. Please, authors, let your characters live their lives as you have created them.
