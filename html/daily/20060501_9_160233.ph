For those of you trying to snausage (or equivalent) me over the weekend: I was in the Troy/Clifton Park area. Cryptic has five RPI alums (including a CEO who was profiled in Forbes) and they asked us to come to a games curriculum chat as well as a one-day games symposium. (I spent Sunday with family.)

Oh yeah. They asked us for money too. Funny how that works out, yeah?
