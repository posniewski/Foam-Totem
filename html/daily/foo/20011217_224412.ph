There's a bunch of people out there who want to preserve all of those old arcade games which I dropped many a quarter into in days past. Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to get one representative of every coin-op game ever played because when newer games came out, they reused the cabinets and a bunch of the circuitry. Basically, the upgraded the box to play a new game.
