Book review:<br>
<b>The Touch</b> and <b>Vamphyri!</b>, Brian Lumley

I read the Titus Crow books (revolving around the Cthulu mythos) by Lumley some years ago and liked them. I happened on these two in the used book store and picked them up. They're both part of a series called "Necroscope", which is about a guy who can speak to the dead, the mysterious workings of E-Branch (the secret British service for people of special talent), and other things in that vein.

<i>Vamphyri!</i> was pretty dull. It picks up later on, but it could have been half the length. The basic plot is: Vampires bad, go attempt to kill wily vampire. I didn't care much for the characters; it didn't seem like there really was a main character at all.

On the other hand, I thought <i>The Touch</i> was pretty good and stood fairly well on its own. Scott St. John comes into some Necroscopic powers and struggles with how (or if) he should use them to avenge the death of his wife. And save the world. (Other who have read the rest of the umpteen Necroscope books think *this* book was dull, since it doesn't have vampires in it. On the other hand, this book actually has a protagonist.)
