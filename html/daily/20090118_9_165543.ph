O cute little arrow in a circle, what is your point? Clicking on you 
reveals an vaguely-related iTunes Store page. You are in every column, 
but no matter which is clicked, the same not entirely unrelated page is the result. Perhaps you could send me to a page about David Bowie when I click on the artist name, for example? Why always send me to a page for an album by a 
David Bowie cover band?
