They have a couple kinds, but I got the \"Road ID Slim\" which is a small ID on a standard silicone bracelet. They are pretty cheap: $15 and you can put any text you want on it. (I put my name, contact numbers, \"no allergies\", etc.)\n\nIf you want to get one of these, you can use this coupon code and get a buck off: ThanksShannon13853851.
