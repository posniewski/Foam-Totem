    "content":"Apologies to anyone reading Foam Totem with a Atom\/RSS reader. I managed to spew a giant number of Twitter entries in there. I do expect an increase in posts to the feed since I am now reflecting things from Facebook to it, but that was just silly.\n\nAnyway, the feed is now cleansed of that cruft and I also made sure it was validating correctly. Or at least mostly correctly.\n\n(One side effect of going entirely to CSS for all formatting is that the feed comes out unformatted in readers. I haven't done any research to see if this is fixable. It would be cool if I could at least do some layout.)",
