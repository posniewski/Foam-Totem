She then enumerates all of these draconian penalties that would have basically shut down some or all of the defendant's businesses, and laments that they were not imposed.  It isn't clear whether the author is aware of the impact this would have on the financial system and the public at large.  Am I supposed to be outraged that the bank with my retirement savings isn't going to fail tomorrow?\n\nLook I really empathize with these 99 percent people, but they really need to come up with a reality-based narrative. Couldn't the author have suggested a remedy for the public that is actually actionable?",

The purpose of the regulations being enforced here is to protect the public confidence in banking, and that is not acheived if 50 million of them have their retirement accounts randomly closed, not to mention whatever other random badness results from some of the most popular securities disappearing from the market.\n\nMost of us here use some form of root-cause analysis, and are familiar with the idea of finding how a process failed while deliberately avoiding assigning blame to the actors.  We use RCA because it works, and because assigning blame (eg firing people) generally doesn't.

His ability to do that is from his prowess as a programmer allowing him to have such a sweet ride.\n\nTherefore, I suggest the best course of action is to invent Skynet and time travel, and send a Terminator back in time to either:\n\n* convince me to not make friends with Shannon \n* convince a young version of Aaron that he really should have been a firefighter or a plumber\n* assassinate a young Philip Pullman so he doesn't write Amber Spyglass\n* convince Pullman while he was editing Amber Spyglass that his ridiculous description of God was souring his trilogy and that he should perhaps reread Subtle Knife and make a superior sequel\n* destroy all banks",

The purpose of the regulations being enforced here is to protect the public confidence in banking, and that is not acheived if 50 million of them have their retirement accounts randomly closed, not to mention whatever other random badness results from some of the most popular securities disappearing from the market.\n\nMost of us here use some form of root-cause analysis, and are familiar with the idea of finding how a process failed while deliberately avoiding assigning blame to the actors.  We use RCA because it works, and because assigning blame (eg firing people) generally doesn't.  My point is that the public should be demanding effective measures from the government that will prevent a recurrence, rather than whatever self-destructive retribution this article's author is asking for.",

His ability to do that is from his prowess as a programmer allowing him to have such a sweet ride.\n\nTherefore, I suggest the best course of action is to invent Skynet and time travel, and send a Terminator back in time to either:\n\n* convince me to not make friends with Shannon \n* convince a young version of Aaron that he really should have been a firefighter or a plumber\n* assassinate a young Philip Pullman so he doesn't write Amber Spyglass\n* convince Pullman while he was editing Amber Spyglass that his ridiculous description of God was souring his trilogy and that he should perhaps reread Subtle Knife and make a superior sequel\n* destroy all banks",
