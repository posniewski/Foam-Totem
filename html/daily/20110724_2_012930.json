Besides the pure idiocy of the plot, Ford fails to look dashing, charming, quick in the face of adversity. He looks tired and worn out. He and LeBouf have no chemistry; no underlying charm he had with Connery. (Yes, yes: This is all old news, but they missed the mark so much it re-blew my mind.)",

Besides the pure idiocy of the plot, Ford fails to look dashing, charming, quick in the face of adversity. He looks tired and worn out. He and LeBouf have no chemistry; no underlying charm he had with Connery. (Yes, yes: This is all old news, but they missed the mark so much it re-blew my mind.)",
