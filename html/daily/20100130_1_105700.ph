<div class="title">iPad: Meh AND Woot</div>
	<p>My main impression of the iPad announcement is that it is unimaginative and boring. It's a double-sized iPhone, without a camera. That's pretty disappointing. Apple's track record for designing and executing cutting edge and game-changing devices is amazing, and what they showed me was a bigger version of less than what we've got now. That's not the kind of thing I was hoping for from Apple when they finally decided to come out with a tablet.</p>
<p>You see, I've been dying for a real slate computer for many years. In 1989 or so, I designed (in concept) a computer which would replace my note-taking system at college. Ever since, I've wanted this electronic clipboard. The 90s gave us Go and PenPoint, and later the Newton. Microsoft replied to these with Windows for Pen, which was not even quarter-assed. Jobs returned to save Apple and murdered the Newton. Palm completely took over the PDA market. Palm filled that niche so well that it pretty much killed touch computing until Microsoft tried again with Windows XP for Tablets. That sank and fell into the swamp. And then Microsoft tried again with their Origami projects. That burned, sank, and fell into the swamp. Each time, I was hoping that it would be "the time". But it never came.</p>
<p>I have a HP TC1100, which is a slate computer. It runs Windows XP Tablet. I mostly use it to read email and browser the web when sitting in bed or on the couch. It's not touch sensitive, but requires a pen, which is a little irritating. It's just enough for me to want more.</p>
<p>And then I got an iPhone. I suddenly had the sum of human knowledge available at my beck and call (AT&amp;T&#39;s weakness notwithstanding). I knew where I was all the time. And take pictures of it. I could twitter and blog and verb2.0 anything I wanted. All in the palm of my hand. I&#39;ve never been more amazed by a piece of technology.<p></p>So, Apple was FINALLY going to make a tablet. Squeee! How could it not be the culmination of human technical achievement?! Gimme! Gimme!</p>
<p>But the iPad is merely the fantastic awesomeness of the iPhone in a much more attractive and usable form factor and an unheard of price point. Myself and other techno-geeks were hoping for something out of left field. A Wow! moment of some kind. But there really wasn't one for us. And hence the general consensus: Meh.</p>
<p>But the reality is different. The iPad is an amazing device and they're going to sell a bazillion of them.</p>
