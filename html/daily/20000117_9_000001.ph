<b>Martin Luther King Jr. Day</b><br>

MP3.com, which generally toes the line with the recording industry has done
something a little subversive. They've created an app which will look at the
ID of a CD loading into your computer and make all of its tracks immediately
available to you via streaming MP3 off their servers. So, if I "beam" up my
CD collection at home, it'll be available (through MP3.com) at work.

Pretty neat, all you need to do now is have everyone share a username
and password to get access to everyone's CDs.
