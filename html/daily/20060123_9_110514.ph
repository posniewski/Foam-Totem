Went snowboarding at <a href="http://www.skiheavenly.com/">Heavenly</a> (at lake Tahoe) over the weekend. I'm getting much better. I'm chaining turns and can almost-but-not-quite decide exactly when and where I want to turn. I'm also confident enough (except right after I fall) to actually pick up some speed, which makes turning actually easier.

No tricks yet. No broken body parts yet. To early to say if there's a correlation there...
