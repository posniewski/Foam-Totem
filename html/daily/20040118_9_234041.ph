Just when you thought it was safe to listen to my music collection and not be attacked by bongos: <a href="http://comfortstand.com/catalog/001/index.html">a CD of strange and unusual music</a> from the crazy swingers on the exotica mailing list. It's all newly composed and recorded and is free to download and burn.

I have dreamt about records that, by all rights, shouldn't have existed. Records that never should have been made. Shotgun weddings and unlikely juxtapositions where styles and genres mingled and smashed up against each other in inadvisable combinations.
