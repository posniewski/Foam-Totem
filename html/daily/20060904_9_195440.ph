I received this as a gift for my birthday this year. (I can't remember if I had wishlisted it or not; I do remember considering <i>The Dante Club</i> by the same author at some point). The novel explores Edgar Allen Poe's largely unexplained death in 1849. It's written as a first-person memoir of Quentin Clark, who is brought to the brink of ruin by obsessively investigating the circumstances of Poe's death. 

Clark enlists the aid of the real-life inspiration for Poe's hyper-rational detective in <i>The Murders of the Rue Morgue</i>: C. Auguste Dupin. Of course, he needs to figure out who that is first... and is the person he finds really Poe's Dupin or just a poe-seur?

The main characters in the story are fictional, but the majority of incidental characters are based on fact. It takes place in historically accurate Baltimore and Paris and has a fair bit of interesting information about what it was like then.

Verdict: It's a pretty good read if you're into the general subject matter. It was perhaps a bit directionless and slow in the middle, and the conclusion is more Arthur Conan Doyle than Clive Cussler.
