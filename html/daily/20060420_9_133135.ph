I haven't read the comic in a long time, so I wasn't poisoned much with comparisons. The movie was pretty good, but I felt the plot sagged under the weight of the metaphor with our current government. It was unneeded. There's a lot of story to tell and perhaps some of it should have been left out rather than left dangling or not making sense. That said, there are parts which are very good: I liked Stephen Fry's character, V is done well considering that his face is literally a mask for the entirety of the movie, V's end is handled well.

The ending left me a bit disappointed, though. The event should have felt epic and  world-shifting. Instead it felt flat. I don't want to say much more as I don't want to give too much away.

Still, a good movie, but not one which will foment "regime change" at home.

(I saw this when it came out and forgot to post.)
