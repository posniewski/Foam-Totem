We occasionally use a chat program here at work, so I have one running all the time. I might not respond immediately (even if you see me on the NPCam). You can contact me on any of the following servcies with the given username. (I use <a href="http://www.trillian.cc">Trillian</a> for my chat program which chats on all the networks simultaneously.)

Clever the way I changed my screen name around there, huh? If you want to chat, make sure you tell me who you are if the screen name isn't obvious. Otherwise, I might assume you are advertising enlargement of some kind.
