In the fantastic-concept-with-flawed-execution department: <a href="http://dylanhearsawho.com/">Dylan Hears a Who</a> pays homage to both Dr. Seuss and Bob Dylan. I think the songs are damaged by over-doing the Dylan-esque whine/sneer/whatever-the-hell-you-call-the-way-he-sang-early-in-his-career.

Green Eggs and Ham is one of the better ones, at least for the first verse or so.

Update: Miss Gertrude McFuzz is good too.
