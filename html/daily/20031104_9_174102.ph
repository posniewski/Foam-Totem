I had no plans to make a costume for Hallowe'en this year, but I was invited to a South Seas-themed party. Muon Hotep would not be denied! He sent one of his more evil-looking minions, as you can see to the right.

The original idea was to go only as a Maori warrior, which is basically the same thing as you see except with a scary tattooed face instead of a big scary mask. Although you can't see it (and I have no picture to prove it) I did make up my face as well since I figured I wouldn't be wearing the mask for long. The arm tattoos on the outside of the arm were much cooler than the ones you see. Painting them and my face took about 45 minutes. I used water-based blue and black (mixed together) stage makeup which worked surprisingly well. Modesty required that I wear a shirt, which had to be dyed a flesh-like color (RIT dye: 1 tsp tan and a 3/4 tsp rose pink).

All told, about 8 hours on the costume (with the shopping) whioch had to be done on the same day as our milestone. Which we hit.

I answered the door for trick-or-treaters in the mask. Small children thought it was scary, so it must have succeeded.
