<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0803/p01s02-usec.html">Savings rate at zero percent for last month.</a>

Somebody explain to me what incentive there is for Americans to save money. Greenspan is worried about the low savings rate, yet at the same time the interest rate is kept so low that you can barely get a return on any money you do save. That's assuming you aren't losing money from inflation or the value of the dollar shifting.

(I happen to be a saver, but only because of personal hang-ups.)
