<i>District 9</i> picks up the story ten years after an alien spaceship filled with hundreds of survivors is marooned on Earth. The refugees ("Prawns", a slur) live in a slum under the ship. The Prawns seem pretty stupid on the whole and are very strong. Human/"Prawn" relations are deteriorating and the humans decide to evict them and move them further from the city.

It's filmed documentary-style (mostly), focusing on a middle manager who is assigned to head up the move. Let's just say things don't go as expected.

Go see District 9. Besides just being a good movie, you get to see many bodies turn into exploding goo.
