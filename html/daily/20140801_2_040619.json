    "message":"Magic Kingdom II. Incredibly hot today: Early entry for Seven Dwarves mine train (meh). Breakfast muffin. Space Mountain (again; I think it's still the best coaster in WDW). Philharmagic (fun, 3D didn't entirely work). Haunted Mansion (again). Hall of Presidents (redone at some point, not as powerful as I remember). Lunch. Swiss Family Robinson Treehouse. Tiki tiki tiki tiki tiki Room. Pirates of the Carribean (again).  No Dole Whips :-(. Had orange whirls. Jungle Cruise with Steven Wright. Steam train 1.3 times around. Carousel of Progress (again; a specific request of Aidan's, inexplicably). Stitch's Escape. Dinner with animatronic lounge singer. Tom Sawyer Island. Splash Mountain. Big Thunder Mountain (again). Fireworks and desserts on Tomorrowland Terrace. Bus to resort. Shower. Sleeeeeeeeep.\n\nWe had intended on returning to the resort in the middle of the day, but it didn't happen that way. Made for a long day!\n\nPictured: Aidan approves of Space Mountain (and also manages to keep his eyes shut even when no flash is used).",
