    "message":"This morning I found an irrigation pipe which we previously fixed with happy rainbow duct tape had a catastrophic failure. And since California is having its worst drought of all time going on, we went out and got a proper fitting to fix it. Once fixed, since I was out there, I decided to prune the roses, which (despite the drought) have grown like mad. Now grungy, I figured I'd quickly mow the back lawn... and managed to shear not one, but two, pop-up sprinklers. (You see, they aren't \"pop-down\" sprinklers, are they?) So off to the hardware store to look for replacements for sprinklers that aren't made any more. We chose a random brand and hoped that everything would just work without digging up the back yard. Surprisingly, they just screwed in without any drama. And now today is done.\n\nIt was rather like being at Camp, but with no bugs.",

            "message":"This morning I found an irrigation pipe which we previously fixed with happy rainbow duct tape had a catastrophic failure. And since California is having its worst drought of all time going on, we went out and got a proper fitting to fix it. Once fixed, since I was out there, I decided to prune the roses, which (despite the drought) have grown like mad. Now grungy, I figured I'd quickly mow the back lawn... and managed to shear not one, but two, pop-up sprinklers. (You see, they aren't \"pop-down\" sprinklers, are they?) So off to the hardware store to look for replacements for sprinklers that aren't made any more. We chose a random brand and hoped that everything would just work without digging up the back yard. Surprisingly, they just screwed in without any drama. And now today is done.\n\nIt was rather like being at Camp, but with no bugs.",
