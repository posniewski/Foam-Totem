If you were to cross Alien with Event Horizon you might get something like Pandorum. It should come as no surprise that if you were to average their reviews you also get Pandorum's review.

A couple of spaceship crewmen are woken up from suspended animation and have amnesia. (A logical side effect of hypersleep and not an obvious and convenient plot device, I assure you.) The ship is on the outs, with the power going up and down, scary crunching noises and so on. Oh, and ravenous, nearly unkillable man-eating humanoid monsters which are running around the ship. (These monsters are clearly not Reavers stolen from the set of Serenity, I assure you.) 

So, there's a lot of running around in the dark with flashlights. And slime. And sidekicks-who-are-at-first-untrusting-adversaries-but-then-team-up. And some fighting. Did I mention the slime? More of a slurry, really, with body chunks in it at one point.

The ending is satisfying enough, and although the final result is perhaps predictable how we get there is not entirely. Even if there is amnesia and some Reavers.

So, mildly recommended. Worth a matinee. Certainly a fine rental (once it comes out) if you're looking for spooky sci-fi.
