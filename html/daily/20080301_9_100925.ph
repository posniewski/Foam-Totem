Book review:<br>
<b>Vitals</b>, Greg Bear

I've read a bunch of Greg Bear over the years, starting with <i>Blood Music</i> (which I liked). <i>Vitals</i> is Bear's attempt at a conspiracy techno-thriller. The book opens with a longevity research scientist traveling to the bottom of the ocean with a flatulent pilot who goes insane and tries to kill the scientist. The book doesn't improve appreciably. The overall conceit is OK, but it's just not written well. Stick to <i>Darwin's Radio</i> and <i>Darwin's Children</i> if you want to read something by Bear.
