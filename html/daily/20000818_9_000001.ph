Bad news: <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/courtweb/pdf/D02NYSC/00-08117.PDF">The court finds that DeCSS is illegal. (pdf)</a> DeCSS is a program which allows playback of (any) DVDs on Linux boxes. Of course, this program is open source (freely available to anyone) and defeats DVD encryption. The MPAA flipped out and sued 2600, who posted DeCSS on their website. The judge ruled that 2600 was bad.

The EFF (providing counsul to 2600) has a good <a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/Video/MPAA_DVD_cases/20000808_ny_post_trial_brief.html">post-trial memorandum on the DeCSS case</a>.
