Would someone please explain to me why a president who conspired to lie and mislead the American public-- putting thousands of troops in danger and over a hundred killed-- isn't sitting in front of Congress right now explaining his actions?

The previous president lied when directly asked about an indiscretion which put no one in danger or killed anyone, and Congress tried to impeach him.

What the hell is going on?!
