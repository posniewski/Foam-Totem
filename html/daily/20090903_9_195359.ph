I am torn by <i>Inglourious Basterds</i>. Quentin Tarantino has contracted the same disease Stephen King has. Both have such a reputation that they can do whatever they want. What they often need is an editor to say "I know you're brilliant and everyone thinks your aces, but maybe you don't need a 20 minute dialog about nothing." That said, Basterds is nowhere as bad as the unremittingly boring <i>Death Proof</i>. Even the great chase scene at the end of DP doesn't fully make up for the rest.

Basterds (Tangent: what's with the misspellings anyway?) is good, though. It's very tense and the main Nazi character is thoroughly horrifying. He's not your obviously evil Nazi with the "Heil Hitlering"-ing and the shouting and the Jew-hating. He's soulless. He's relentless and smart and utterly amoral. More than the Inglourious Basterds, he is the real star of the movie. The actor, Christoph Waltz, does brilliantly.

Yes, there is violence. There's a mass murder of hundreds of Nazis in cold blood. Things are carved into flesh. It IS a Tarantino movie, ya know.

Vaguely recommended.
