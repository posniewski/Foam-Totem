It appears that the IS NO IMPENDING CRISIS with Social Security right now. If nothing is changed at all, then the benefit payout will outpace the tax revenue in 2018. However, there's a trust fund underneath all of this; if nothing changes, benefits will still be paid out IN FULL until 2042.

It seems to me that the President's concerns about Social Security is completely disingenuous. His other policies are causing a GIGANTIC revenue defecit. It seems to me that the real crisis we should be addressing isn't something which might happen in 2042, but huge debts we are racking up now. It's a ploy to distract us.

Speaking of which, all this hubub about "lacking confidence" in Rumsfeld is another sleight-of-hand. Rumsfeld has been set up as the fall guy for America's failures in Iraq. His removal or resignation will be done at the moment that the citizenry is maximally disgusted with our performance in Iraq. This will let the President and the Republican party hide from allegations that they rushed into a war of choice with inadequate resources executing to a inappropriate plan.

The buck stops at the Oval Office, not on the Defense Secretary's desk.

It's easy to get sidetracked, since it is indeed true that Social Security may one day run out and that Rumsfeld is a flaming jackass. I hope that we don't lose sight of the bigger issues at the same time.
