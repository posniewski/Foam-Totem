A caper/heist movie with great actors and a good conceit(s) for the plot. All together, though, these only ended up making a good, but not great, movie. A poor editing choice early on made the pivotal twist (of many twists) predictable (at least to me). There's some really good stuff in the middle, but the biggest moments felt weak to me. Worth a rent. (Better than Ocean's 12, not as good as Ocean's 11.)
