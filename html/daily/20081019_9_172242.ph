College kids go on a haunted boat ride on the New Orleans bayou and are brutally dismembered by a monster. Hatchet makes the cliche fun by not taking itself too seriously. It's not gruesome uncomfortable terror-gore like the Saw films. It's bad-guy-pulling-off-latex-arms-and-legs kind of gore. The writing is in the "Buffy/Angel" vein (in fact, one of the actors was in Buffy/Angel) and is a step above typical horror fare.

It's worth adding it to your Netflix queue (if horror is your thing).
