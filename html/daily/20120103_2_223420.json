This is not a \"slippery slope\" problem at all, because it codifies censorship based on a private party's say-so with no court involved. (The slippery slope we skidded down to get here was the DMCA.)\n\nNo reasonable person against SOPA wants to further copyright infringement. That is not the counter-argument at all. The counter-argument is that if anyone anywhere posts something on any of Boston.com's web sites (classifieds, comment section, letters to the editor, etc) that someone else doesn't like, SOPA could be used nuke the entire boston.com domain. With no notice. And no due process. All they have to say (regardless of truth) is that it's theirs and BAM! your DNS entries are gone.\n\nPlease, please, please listen to those who understand and literally invented the systems you're trying to tinker with before mandating things that will break them.",

This is not a \"slippery slope\" problem at all, because it codifies censorship based on a private party's say-so with no court involved. (The slippery slope we skidded down to get here was the DMCA.)\n\nNo reasonable person against SOPA wants to further copyright infringement. That is not the counter-argument at all. The counter-argument is that if anyone anywhere posts something on any of Boston.com's web sites (classifieds, comment section, letters to the editor, etc) that someone else doesn't like, SOPA could be used nuke the entire boston.com domain. With no notice. And no due process. All they have to say (regardless of truth) is that it's theirs and BAM! your DNS entries are gone.\n\nPlease, please, please listen to those who understand and literally invented the systems you're trying to tinker with before mandating things that will break them.",
