Perhaps privitizing everything you can get your hands on isn't a good thing: <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0731-09.htm">civilian military contractors can't be ordered into a combat zone</a>.

Even better, they don't even know how much it is costing since there are so many contracts. Maybe some things are done better in-house?
