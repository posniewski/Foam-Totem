Media update Part 2: The Television Sequel.

<a href="http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_supersites/zim/"><i>Invader ZIM</i></a> [Nick]: See below for comments on the Halloween special. Stories are original and definitely not normal (or maybe even sane), characters are hysterical, and the animation is really good.

<a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/jack/"><i>Samauri Jack</i></a> [Cartoon Network]: This is just a great cartoon. It references everything from film to Hanna-Barbara cartoons to anime and does it all with in a brilliantly spartan style.

<a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/alias/home/indexcia.html"><i>Alias</i></a> [ABC]: Oh my goodness! I'm watching a spy show on network television and I like it! Ahhhh! Alias has good fights, a strong (but vulnerable, of course, and sassy in every hair color and style) female lead, and all sorts of intrigue. The pilot is fantastic and the episodes thus far have been nearly (though not quite) up to the pilot.

<a href="http://www.mutantx.net/homepage.html"><i>Mutant-X</i></a> [syndicated - WB near me]: This show is terrible. It's not even so-bad-it's-good. It's simply bad. Avoid it.

Media update. Here's my thoughts on recent movies.

<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0245674"><i>13 Ghosts</i></a>: Really great production design, great start, some nice deaths (including a person who gets cut in half vertically from top to bottom-- yeah!), but weak ending and woefully lacking in plot or smarts. Better than <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0229260">Blair Witch 2</a>.

<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120681"><i>From Hell</i></a>: Another visual treat, this time with more of a plot to hang it on. Significant liberties taken with the <a href="http://www.eddiecampbellcomics.com/fromhell/">comic's plot</a>, but only one is really bad (vague due to possible spoilage). Some scene composition taken directly from the comic (including a great time-lapse). Several too many green backlit shadows. Worth matinee prices, may be worth regular price.

<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0139654"><i>Training Day</i></a>: I don't like cop movies as a general rule, but went to <i>Training Day</i> since friends wanted to. The last time I did this it was for either <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0232500"><i>The Fast and Furious</i></a> or <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0246544"><i>The Musketeer</i></a>, so the augury was not positive. But, it was really good. Worth regular price. Go see it if you can handle seeing corrupt and brutal plainsclothes vice cops.

<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0108148"><i>Iron Monkey</i></a>: Walk out your door now, get in your car, and go see this movie. It's got great fights, a good plot, just the right touch of campiness, and is a lot of fun.

<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0261392"><i>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</i></a>: If you like any of Kevin Smith's movies (Clerks, Chasing Amy, Dogma) go see this movie. It's a romp using the characters from all of them and is just generally a good time. If you don't know these movies, don't bother, though.
