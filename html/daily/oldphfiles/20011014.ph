The terrorists aren't the only ones who claim that God is on their side. Every morning, many of our public schools confirm that we are "one nation under God."

The original Pledge of Allegience (penned in 1892 by <a href="http://www.vineyard.net/vineyard/history/pdgech4.htm">Francis Bellamy</a>) didn't have the offensive little phrase. It was added in 1954 by Congress. At the time, President Eisenhower said, "In this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America's heritage and future; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country's most powerful resource in peace and war."

<a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/nat_mott.htm">In 1956, Congress declared "In God We Trust" to be the national motto of the United States.</a>

With all of the rhetoric about our enemies being <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/134353757_evil14.html">"evil"</a> one might wonder if there is a Secretary of Faith in the <a href="http://www.sls.lib.il.us/reference/por/cabinet.html">President's cabinet</a>.

Wow: The FBI believes that 11 of the <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/waronterrorism/story/0,1373,573707,00.html">hijackers didn't know it was a suicide mission</a>.

There is a lot of propaganda out there. I have heard it said on TV (and the web) that our involvement with Israel has nothing to do with this. <a href="http://www.forward.com/issues/2001/01.10.05/ed.html">I find that hard to understand.</a> I'm not saying that we should change our policies there, but I don't know why we're pretending that it has nothing to do with it.

<a href="http://www.twf.org/News/Y2001/0815-GandhiZionism.html">Ghandi's thoughts on the formation of Israel.</a>

After I posted the Ghandi link, I felt like I should label it as coming from a pro-Islam (maybe anti-anti-Islam?) site. Should I also feel the need to label the link from the Observer as <font size="-1
"><b>[UK "special relationship"]</b></font> and the link from The Forward as <font size="-1"><b>[Jewish conservative]</b></font>? Hmmm. I'll leave it to you to decide who you want to believe.
