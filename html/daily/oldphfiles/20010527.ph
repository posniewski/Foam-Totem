I've just dumped all the <a href="/photos/memday2001/?M=A">pictures taken over Memorial Day</a> with the cheap-ass Intel camera. There aren't any descriptive names or anything, so click and be surprised.

Woo hoo! <a href="/photos/cedarpoint2001/?M=A">Cedar Point pictures</a> as well!

I also dumped <a href="/photos/newyears2001/?M=A">rv's New Year's pictures</a> for your perusal. Again, nothing fancy, just a directory listing.

All of these pictures should be in rough chronological order.
