I just finished watching the <a href="http://revolutionsf.com/article/551.html">"Halloween Spetacular of Spooky Doom" episode of <i>Invader Zim</i></a>. Oh. My. God. It was the most flat-out insane thing I have ever seen. <a href="http://www.tvguidelines.org/guidelin.htm">It was rated "TV-Y"!!!</a> I'd be surprised if children weren't permanently scarred by the episode. It was one of the most actually crazy (I'm talking honest-to-god madness here) I have ever seen (and I've seen <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0105665"><i>Fire Walk With Me</i></a>) It was great.

I'm not a big Chomsky fan, per se, but I thought this <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/chomskyterror.html">talk by Chomsky is asking the same questions that I ask</a>. I don't know how many of his answers and information is accurate, but the questions and analysis are insteresting.
