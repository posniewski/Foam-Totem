I love October. I love it because cable hauls out all of these <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0082427">grade-B</a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0054215">classic</a> (and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0057449">classic-grade-B</a>) horror films.

<a href="http://www.stratfor.com">Stratfor</a> has been providing fairly lucid analysis regarding the attacks. This <a href="http://www.stratfor.com/SERVICES/GIU/4q2001.htm">forecast for the fourth quarter</a> is an fairly succinct summary of the situation. (Most of the Stratfor site is pay, but a lot of the "<a href="http://www.stratfor.com/home/sitreps.htm">situation reports</a>" stuff isn't.)

A month ago, terrorists crashed planes into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a field in Pennsylvania. I didn't post anything about this when it happened because I didn't really know what to think or how to react. I still can't really get my head around the crashes as actual events: I saw them happen on TV, not in real life.

Anyway, my moratorium on "America Strikes Back" links is over.

All they are saying is <a href="http://www.indymedia.org:8081/peace/">give peace a chance</a>.
