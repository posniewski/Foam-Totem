"Come aaaahhhhnnnn! Let's play Feuuuuuuuuud!" I can't believe Louie Anderson is employed in any capacity. He's so horrible. Do people actually watch this show of their own free will? It's enough to make me lie back and long for death.

In order to get through this, I've started fantasizing that the host of Family Feud isn't Louie Anderson -- it's elfin performance art diva Laurie Anderson. Laurie comes out on stage playing the theme song on her electric violin. Behind her, huge screens show repeating film clips of telephone poles and deserted mesas. Laurie welcomes us to the show: "There was this man. And there was this woman. And they were playing..." Plink, plink, plink. "... Family Feud." She paces around the stage. "It was a long road." Glance at the telephone poles. "It was a very..." Plink, plink. "... Long road." And then she plays an eight-minute piano solo on her tie.
