    "message":"Unable to watch more any more of the debate. I want Obama to demand answers and forcefully confront the un-and-half-truths that are being levied against him. Patiently explaining Obamacare again is the same as losing. He should be boldly declaiming its virtues.\n\nI think he's trying to sound reasoned, but I'm hearing apologetic and mealy-mouthed. I think the only way to win against liars is to confront them with the truth until they have nothing left. Romney can't run away from the debate podium. Obama could probably have just said \"Where's that money coming from?\" over and over again to Romney. Plans say it can be done? \"Oh, you mean plans done by right-wing think tanks that drove us into the 2008 crash and recession?\"\n\nI also think being on the offensive against current Republicanism would have knocked Romney back on his heels.\n\nBut I'm not an expensive political consultant. I just want it to end.\n\n\/politics off.",

I think the only way to win against liars is to confront them with the truth until they have nothing left. Romney can't run away from the debate podium. Obama could probably have just said \"Where's that money coming from?\" over and over again to Romney. Plans say it can be done? \"Oh, you mean plans done by right-wing think tanks that drove us into the 2008 crash and recession?\"\n\nI also think being on the offensive against current Republicanism would have knocked Romney back on his heels.\n\nBut I'm not an expensive political consultant.
