<img src="/daily/spatula.jpg" border="0" align="right"/>Safety Tip: Don't accidentally cut your thumb off with the World's Most Ludicrously Deadly Spatula (pictured at right). Why would you put a cross-cut wood saw on the edge of a spatula?

As luck would have it, I didn't remove my thumb. I did manage to slice it pretty badly. As I was carefully tending to it I very nearly passed out. It was very odd; one minute I was aligning the laceration so it'll heal properly (and felt fine) and the next I'm stumbling and having difficulty getting to a chair 10 feet away. Funny what blood loss and adrenalin can do to you.

Anyway, it seems OK now. No chunks were removed and it doesn't hurt. The likelihood of permanent disfigurement appears low.

(Next time, if you're good little girls and boys, I'll post a picture of the wound.)
