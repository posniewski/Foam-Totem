    "content":"\nBy now, the morning was nearly routine. We got up, packed, washed, had breakfast, and got our packs together. The highlight for me, once again, was the fresh mango. And, like my last post, I'm shocked to find that I haven't mentioned our beloved <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Milo_(drink)\">Milo<\/a>.\n\nMilo is a chocolate and malt drink mix. It, along with tea and instant coffee, was available at every snack and meal. We found it was tasty if you added a scoop or two of creamer in with it. I should also mention that the coffee drinkers in the group brought up real coffee as the instant was unacceptable to them.\n\n<figure>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/kili\/karanga-meru-dawn.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/kili\/karanga-meru-dawn-thumb.jpg\"><\/a>\n<figcaption>Dawn shadow of Kilimanjaro at Karanga Camp, Mount Meru in distance<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\nAgain, the night had been quite cold, but a short while after the sun came up it was easily 20 degrees warmer. It was clear and sunny our whole trip, which was a huge blessing. I can imagine it being quite cold if had stayed overcast. Sunglasses and sunblock was required every day, but there was no so little atmosphere, that the light was quite harsh.\n\n<figure>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/kili\/barafu-trail.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/kili\/barafu-trail-thumb.jpg\"><\/a>\n<figcaption>Looking back along the trail, Uhuru Peak lost in the clouds on the right.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\nThe first part of today's trek would take us from Karanga to Barafu. This is a two mile walk that goes up around 2,000 ft. Mercifully, there wasn't any more of the up and down from the previous two days. We are actually ascending and every foot we went up would bring us closer to the peak.\n\n<figure>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/kili\/barafu-break.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/kili\/barafu-break-thumb.jpg\"><\/a>\n<figcaption>Fancy Goggles!<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\nThe ridge that we would be walking along (or just behind, actually) was to our left for most of the hike. Though fairly close (compared to a couple days ago, it was VERY close) it looked very steep. And we would be walking it in just over 12 hours.\n\n<figure>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/kili\/barafu-trail-2.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/kili\/barafu-trail-2-thumb.jpg\"><\/a>\n<figcaption>Arrival at Barafu Camp<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\nAfter the Barranco Wall, the trail had been pretty bleak and desolate. Today's trail would be no different. There was no vegetation, no animals, and very little to see but the trail vanishing in the distance. We slowly climbed our way towards Barafu across blackened, blasted stone and dust. On the trail it was monotonous, but I see a hint of that beautiful barrenness that the desert sometimes has.\n\n<figure>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/kili\/barafu-camp.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/kili\/barafu-camp-thumb.jpg\"><\/a>\n<figcaption>Barafu is on quite a slope.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\nEventually, we made it Barafu Camp. This is the last Camp before the summit for several of the routes. The Camp sprawled uncomfortably up the ridge. There were a lot of people making camps. We were on the side of the camp furthest from the summit.\n\n<figure>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/kili\/barafu-craig.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/kili\/barafu-craig-thumb.jpg\"><\/a>\n<figcaption>Craig works on his journal during the break.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\nWe had lunch and then had a couple hours to relax and rest before dinner. After dinner, we would get four or so hours of sleep, then get up at 11pm and begin our trip to the top.\n\n<figure>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/kili\/raven-energy.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/kili\/raven-energy-thumb.jpg\"><\/a>\n<figcaption>At Barafu, even the ravens need energy drinks.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\nWhen writing these, I've been referring to my journal to help me remember what we ate, how people were feeling, and so on. However, I failed with my journal at this point. There's a comment at the end, which says:\n\n<blockquote>\n<i>Too tired, busy, or damaged<br\/>\nto write narrative for the past<br\/>\nfew days. Random notes<br\/>\nfor later:<br\/>\n<br\/>\nKaranga to Barafu\n<\/i>\n<\/blockquote>\n\nThat is the entire list, by the way. Which is one reason why I am writing all this up; I don't want to forget everything! Especially the part that's coming up-- the summit!\n\n<figure>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/posniewski\/Barafu?authuser=0&feat=directlink\">\n<img src=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/kili\/barafu.jpg\" \/><\/a>\n<figcaption>Click here to see more photos from this part of the trip.<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n",
