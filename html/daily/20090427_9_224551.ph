An action movie where an everyman becomes a superman. I thought it was everything that <i>Jumper</i> wasn't, starting with watchable. It was also exciting, not-entirely predictable, and had thousands of rats with tiny little exploding vests. Adorable AND explosive! Oh, and Angelina Jolie's naked, tattooed backside. What's not to like?

Nothing, actually. It was great and I recommend it. A fun time, don't think too hard.
