Quickie Hulk review:

At 138 minutes long, I felt like is was maybe a half hour longer than needed. The beginning of the movie was slow, though an admirable attempt was made at making <i>science!</i> look exciting. The back story is updated a bit for today, taking elements from the Hulk we know from TV and the grittier Hulk of more recent times and mixing it with a little too much "sins of the father" moralizing for my taste. (I guess in an Ang Lee movie, you gotta take the crunchy with the smooth.)

Don't get me wrong: when the Hulk is on the screen he smashes stuff gooood. The trailers made me worry about the animation, but it was ill-placed concern. The action scenes were cool. It occasionally suffered from the "How-many-times-will-his-[opponent]-come-back-from-nowhere-after-[it]-was-killed" syndrome. A couple great scenes with him crushing tanks and elevators and so on.

And then there's the "2001" climax. What was THAT all about?!

Better than Star Trek: Nemesis. Not as good as a Harry Potter Film. Worth a matinee.
