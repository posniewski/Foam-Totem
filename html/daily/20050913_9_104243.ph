From the personal diary of a news cameraman:
<blockquote><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/09/13/katrina_a_cameramans.html">
I’m only writing this because of what I watched on tv last night. It was the first chance I’ve had to see some of the coverage and what I watched was pathetic. [...]

There are almost no news crews in the field trying to cover the story. Hundreds, if not thousands of media people are in the region - but I have driven back and forth through some of the worst neighborhoods in the city and you don’t see them. You don’t see the National Guard... you don’t see ANYONE, except for the poor unfortunate souls wandering the streets looking for food or water.[...]

Everyone on the street says, "Where’s the Red Cross? I gave them so much money after 9/11 and the tsunami - where’s the Red Cross". The cops I’ve asked say they are not here because they are afraid. The Red Cross says that the authorities are not letting them in the city. I find that hard to believe. The police can’t even secure a few blocks, let alone keep the Red Cross out. Helping victims in New Orleans is exactly why the Red Cross was created.
