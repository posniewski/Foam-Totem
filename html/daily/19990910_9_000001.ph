<a href="http://www.gurunet.com">GuruNet</a> is really cool. It's a Windows app which
allows you to Alt-Click on any text and get information about it. A special
browser window pops up with definitions, links, and so forth about that word.
It's fast, too. (At least right now before everyone is using it.) It works
on browsers, Word, DOS windows, titlebars-- just about everything.
