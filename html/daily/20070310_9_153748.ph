This is a live-action version of the <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(comic_book)">Frank Miller graphic novel 300</a>, telling the story of the Battle of Thermopylae. The battle was fought in 480BC to hold the Persians back from Greece against overwhelming odds. In this telling, 300 Spartans kill countless Persians in the attempt. (Historically, the story isn't quite the same (as far as I can tell) but it's quite close.) Thermopylae is a choke point where the a horde doesn't have an advantage as it has to thin down to pass. The narrow road is guarded by 300 Spartans trained from birth to be warriors. Carnage ensues.

Primarily, 300 is a gladiator movie. Though based on history, the movie allows the supernatural (consulting an oracle) and the near-fantastic (ogres, beasts) to be expressed. They aren't fantasy, but exaggerated reality perhaps. This keeps the battles from becoming overly tedious or mundane.

It's very stylish, paced well, and is a pretty good ride. The last bit during the denouement fell flat for me for some reason. The dialogue just didn't ring true... or was too purple or something.

I liked it, overall. Worth seeing it on the big screen; it's very contrasty so seeing at home won't be the same experience.
