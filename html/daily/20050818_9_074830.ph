The WSJ shows <a href="http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/2005/08/more_wsj_agitpr.html">how to mislead with charts</a>.

A subtext to that article and the others below: I don't know how we can get out of our Federal budget defecit without raising taxes. I'm not so sure that cutting spending is realistic in war-time. (I also think that some things are better done by the government rather than private industry. "Security Forces" in Iraq being one of them.)

Some of my more libertarian friends think that the government should regulate little and provide even less (and hence decrease taxes). Yet I've seen no plausible argument on how the rapacious don't screw everyone else when there is no regulation. The power become more powerful and the weak have little chance of stepping up; everything being for-pay is very regressive. I've also seen written that a free markets is only possible when the government makes sure it stays free (i.e. regulates it). (Wish I could remember where...)
