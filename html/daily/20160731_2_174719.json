    "message":"Niantic is making some classic MMO developer mistakes. The list of nearby Pokemon is a buggy mess and there's no way for you to look for a particular kind of Pokemon. So, websites were created -- by people who love the game -- and fans flocked to them (and then, to each other to catch 'em all!). But Niantic doesn't like that so they shut down the third party sites (either directly or indirectly). Terrible mistake.\n\nOnce an social game (MMO) is released, it's as much players' game as it is the dev's game. Everything amazing about the PoGo experience has come from players, not from the developer. Saying \"but that's not how you're supposed to play it!\" loses sight of that. It's is an easy and common mistake to make on MMOs; practically every studio has made it at some point.\n\nIf, for legal (or selfish) reasons, Niantic doesn't want 3rd party websites, they should attack the obvious shortcoming in their game: How do you find Pokemon? The tools are not there to do so. Add them. They don't need to be clones of what fans have made, but they need to address the kind of gameplay that players are getting from those tools. And it's critical to do that before rendering the fans' tools impotent. Socials games need people to be successful. Don't lose people by taking away their fun.",

            "message":"Niantic is making some classic MMO developer mistakes. The list of nearby Pokemon is a buggy mess and there's no way for you to look for a particular kind of Pokemon. So, websites were created -- by people who love the game -- and fans flocked to them (and then, to each other to catch 'em all!). But Niantic doesn't like that so they shut down the third party sites (either directly or indirectly). Terrible mistake.\n\nOnce an social game (MMO) is released, it's as much players' game as it is the dev's game. Everything amazing about the PoGo experience has come from players, not from the developer. Saying \"but that's not how you're supposed to play it!\" loses sight of that. It's is an easy and common mistake to make on MMOs; practically every studio has made it at some point.\n\nIf, for legal (or selfish) reasons, Niantic doesn't want 3rd party websites, they should attack the obvious shortcoming in their game: How do you find Pokemon? The tools are not there to do so. Add them. They don't need to be clones of what fans have made, but they need to address the kind of gameplay that players are getting from those tools. And it's critical to do that before rendering the fans' tools impotent. Socials games need people to be successful. Don't lose people by taking away their fun.",
