It's not a reboot, but fits in with the other movies. I don't know the comics at all, so I have no idea how true it is to the comic canon.\n\n<img class=\"posterous\" src=\"http:\/\/foamtotem.org\/daily\/images\/xmen-reactor.jpg\" \/><center><i>What is Mrs. Peel doing in the reactor room?<\/i><\/center>\n\nIt shows and explains the sudden existence and increase in Mutants, how Prof X, Magneto, and many other mainstays of the series first met. It also introduces the basic schism between Prof X's and Magneto's worldviews. Even though this is a lot of ground to cover, it was a pretty good action movie, though perhaps a bit heavy on the CGI. (Beast in particular was rather awful.) I loved the 60s spy vibe they used. Perhaps it's true to the comics, but the bad guy has a submarine with a sleek and spacious modernist office in it, and even that has a secret door in it. The only thing missing was the cat for him to pet.\n\nAnd Emma Frost (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm0005064\/\">January Jones<\/a>-- how Bond-ian is that?!) comes oh-so-very close to Emma Peel. Or maybe <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/media\/rm116178432\/nm0005064\">Barbarella<\/a>.\n\nGood enough to see in a theater, but there's nothing in it that would make me recommend the theater over home viewing, really.",
