This movie is obviously not God's gift to cinema, but it's a ZOMBIE movie!  Zombie dogs! Evil zombie... whatevers! Milla Jovovich! Milla Jovovich kicking zombie ASS! Milla Jovovich wearing a napkin in a very brightly lit room! AND ZOMBIIIEEEEES!

It takes a lot from John Carpenter. Timing, shocks, and even the synthesized and rather simplistic musical score. The plot is thin, but there is one: evil corporation, viruses, ultimate killing machines, you know the drill. The movie is apparently a prequel to the next game, but the movie isn't too... gamey. Heh. Well. A fun Saturday matinee if you like B horror flicks or Milla Jovovich naked.
