There are several ways to fix this particular problem right now, none of which outlaw HFT. The easiest and simplest (and maybe even fairest) would be a tiny fee on every order. But doing so would magically DESTROY THE MARKET, and there would be RUIN and DISASTER-- if you listen to those who are making huge sums doing this.\n\nI want to say \"The only winning move is not to play\", but even that move is a loser. Remember when you could have a savings account that returned interest? Not any more, because they broke it.  Grumble grumble.\n<\/rant>",
