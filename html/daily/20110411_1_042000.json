    "content":"<p>Here you see the first phase of the Foam Totem revamp. Besides the change to layout and theme, this is largely groundwork. It's now written HTML5 and finally, after eight or more years from when I first attempted it, stylistically driven with a seperate CSS stylesheet. Wonders may never cease.<\/p>\n<p>Next is some data munging. I'm adding some fields to each post (such as title and via) but the current data format I'm using is just a blob of stuff that I cram into the HTML file. I'm only going to modify the data for the most recent months. In fact, I don't plan to modify or regenerate any of the Foam Totem pages before 2011. It'll stick around as is indefinately.<\/p>\n<p>Once the data is structured some, I'll start generating standalone pages for each post. They already have permalinks, but the permalinks direct you an internal anchor (e.g. #20110411_727272) on a monthly page. This works fine for humans, but crossposting to other sites (say Facebook) doesn't work well with this links. By putting each post on its own page, I can specify the summary text, pictures, etc that Facebook and other sites will associate with the post.<\/p>\n<p>After that, I'm going to start looking into commenting again. I'm going to try and reflect any Facebook comments directly here on Foam Totem. At the same time, I don't want to force people to have a Facebook login to comment. I have an idea or two on how to skin that cat, but it will require some hacking before I know if it'll work at all.<\/p>\n<p>(And, yes, I have a backup of the old site in case this goes horribly wrong.)<\/p>",
