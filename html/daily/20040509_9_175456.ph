My <a href="http://www.foamtotem.org/~iaxt">very cool friend Iwan Axt</a> ran (and finished) the Gulf Coast Half Ironman Triathalon. He and his 28 compatriots raised over $225,000 for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. He hasn't posted his own results yet, but I looked them up, primarily to shame him into doing it himself.

He did great against his goals, but you'll have to <a href="http://www.foamtotem.org/~iaxt/tnt">read his weblog</a> for that! Stop by his website and <a href="http://www.foamtotem.org/~iaxt/#sponsor">pledge a donation to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</a> to show your support!
