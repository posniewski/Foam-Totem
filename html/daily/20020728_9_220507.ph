You need a Shoutcast-capable MP3 player. I use <a href="http://www.winamp.com">WinAmp</a>, but there's also <a href="http://www.sonique.com/">Sonique</a> and others. All the Linux user who wants to listen should do a lengthy Google-search to find some sources you can tweak and compile into a player. (OK, OK, <a href="http://www.zinf.org//">Zinf</a> should do it for you.)

I'm having a tough time getting those radio links to work on my computer, but they should work. Perhaps my WinAmp doesn't work right. If those links don't work for you, drop me a line and paste this into WinAmp: http://www.foamtotem.org:8000/lounge)
