A run-of-the-mill thriller starring Liam Neeson as a Jason Bourne equivalent (but much older, fatherly, baritone, and not as cute). He is a divorced ex-black ops guy who's trying to make up lost time with his 17 year old daughter. In a nearly pointless subplot, daughter is loving life with Mom and very rich stepfather. Against his paranoid better judgement, Neeson tries to ingratiate himself to his daughter by letting her go to France.

But of course Neeson's crazy paranoid fantasy comes true and she is kidnapped by human traffickers. Hilarity ensues.

Actually, brutality ensues. Neeson annihilates everyone in the path to his daughter. The end.

The movie does the job minimally. The protagonist murders 30+ people, yet somehow it's still PG13. Note to self: don't kidnap Liam Neeson's daughter.
