    "content":"\nI'm about to go play more L.A. Noire. I've played about 6 hours of it now.\n\nIn B&W mode, the iffy material shaders aren't noticable. I need to do the crime scenes in color though so I can see what is and isn't blood. The cases are pretty good, but it's clear to me that something isn't right about who I'm arresting at the conclusions which makes the cases less than satisfying. I assume that this will be resolved at some point, but it was pretty obvious to me from early on. I feel a bit like I'm going through the motions as I wait for the other shoe to drop.\n\nMy solution to the stupid rock\/paper\/scissors thing? I play with a walkthrough next to me to check my answers beforehand. I decide what I would answer, and then see if the designer was too clever. There was once instance where the suspect was telling the truth, but I was supposed to say that he was lying in order to get more info or something. That's just dumb. I think \"Lie\" really means \"Evidence\"; meaning that you have evidence about the question\/answer.",
