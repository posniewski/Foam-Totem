That's too simplified: the real goal is to cover what is believed to be true in proportions equal to the reputable, non-original sources that Wikipedians can manage to cite, preventing undue coverage of fringe knowledge (even when it's right and the majority is wrong)--a hugely important element of creating worthwhile articles. Hard work is worthless if it's not in alignment with the clearly stated goals of Wikipedia, which are not to be a primary source for any kind of knowledge, but to summarize other non-primary sources. The layers of indirection are what establishes notability.\n\nIn reality, what ends up happening is that the coverage is proportional to what an average white male in America believes, and only if it's easily sourced on the Internet. Sourcing from books or pre-Internet news articles really is hard work, but that's the kind of effort that's needed. It's not ignored when it's done; it's just not done all that often.",

That's too simplified: the real goal is to cover what is believed to be true in proportions equal to the reputable, non-original sources that Wikipedians can manage to cite, preventing undue coverage of fringe knowledge (even when it's right and the majority is wrong)--a hugely important element of creating worthwhile articles. Hard work is worthless if it's not in alignment with the clearly stated goals of Wikipedia, which are not to be a primary source for any kind of knowledge, but to summarize other non-primary sources. The layers of indirection are what establishes notability.\n\nIn reality, what ends up happening is that the coverage is proportional to what an average white male in America believes, and only if it's easily sourced on the Internet. Sourcing from books or pre-Internet news articles really is hard work, but that's the kind of effort that's needed. It's not ignored when it's done; it's just not done all that often.",
