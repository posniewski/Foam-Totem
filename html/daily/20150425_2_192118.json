I watched the first four episodes and I have to say, it's not grabbing me. It would probably be better to watch on a Friday night and not a Saturday afternoon, since they try to do \"scary supernatural stuff\", but as it stands I am ok if the series doesn't return. If it does, I'll gladly catch up and give the second season a go.",
