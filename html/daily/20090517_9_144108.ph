Like most people, I read <i>Angels &amp; Demons</i> after reading <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> and found that it wasn't as tight or as good as Code. It had some interesting stuff in it, but mostly it got the job done and had a couple of pretty good twists. All in all, I could recommend it as an airplane book. This is not an auspicious starting point.

The thing about Dan Brown's novels is that they are about lost knowledge and puzzle solving. Word and logic puzzles don't translate very well to the big screen. Da Vinci tried to show some of this by trying to show how a symbologist/anagrammer might see the world: words popping out from the confusion and assembling themselves and so on. Still, the Da Vinci movie was rather weak. Only one professor has been on the big screen and still been truly exciting: Indiana Jones.

It was possible for <i>Angels &amp; Demons</i> to have been as good as Da Vinci. In fact, the end of A&amp;D could have been much more compelling that Da Vinci. Alas, this movie is a mess. The editing was strange at times. (For example, introducing a fact as something suddenly new-- complete with an ominous music cue-- that the main characters had learned of three minutes earlier.) The actual conceit makes practically no sense. It's about the "God particle", which they carefully explain has nothing to do with God and is a terrible name and in the VERY NEXT SENTENCE say that finding it would practically disprove the existence of God.

Sigh.

The final act is pretty well done, but the three or so leading up to it are just crappy and poorly explained.

So, I can suggest both the book AND the movie when on an airplane. Other than that, don't bother.
