    "message":"Today is City of Heroes' last day of operation, which is very sad for me.\n\nThough I'm very happy with many of the projects I've worked on over my career, I am most proud of the work I did on Cities.  To my colleagues who built and sustained Paragon City, thank you. It's a blow that it will vanish after today.\n\nAt the same time that I'm amazed that it lasted over eight years, I am somehow surprised that it won't be there tomorrow. After so long, I always felt like it would always be there in some form or another. But the very nature of an MMOs means that is no \"retro-gaming\". You can't stick in an old disk and play it for old times' sake (like I did a couple weeks ago for Rollercoaster Tycoon). It's just gone forever.\n\nIt is enormously gratifying that other people loved City of Heroes -- *my* game -- and made it their home for so long. I salute all those Heroes (and Villains) who chose to dispense justice (or evil) in Paragon City. Thank you.",

To my colleagues who built and sustained Paragon City, thank you. It's a blow that it will vanish after today.\n\nAt the same time that I'm amazed that it lasted over eight years, I am somehow surprised that it won't be there tomorrow. After so long, I always felt like it would always be there in some form or another. But the very nature of an MMOs means that is no \"retro-gaming\". You can't stick in an old disk and play it for old times' sake (like I did a couple weeks ago for Rollercoaster Tycoon). It's just gone forever.\n\nIt is enormously gratifying that other people loved City of Heroes -- *my* game -- and made it their home for so long. I salute all those Heroes (and Villains) who chose to dispense justice (or evil) in Paragon City. Thank you.",
