    "message":"Important info for Apple users: Your Apple ID is an email address, not some other login ID you may have been using. Apparently, it could be either and they are they are merging them or something reasons. So, if you try to log in or reset your password (because someone else has without permission and you're panicking and trying to stop them from stealing from you, bricking your phone, tracking your location, dating your significant other, watching your TV, etc etc) and you don't get an email, try your email-based login instead. Maybe before you cancel your credit card, fail to find a \"My ID is compromised\" button on Apple's website because it doesn't exist, drive to an Apple Store with a spasming back where they are only able to make an appointment for three days (!) from now to get help, eventually go home and call 1-800-MY-HATEFUL-APPLE, lie and say your phone with serial number XYZX9123837232708xZOI!#O* is broken, and then tell them that you called for something else entirely.\n\nI will say that once I got to humans, they were nice and sorted everything out.\n\nToday and yesterday have just been filled with suck.",
