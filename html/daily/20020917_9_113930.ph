I flew back to see my parents and extended family over the weekend. As usual, one of the computers wasn't quite working right; we couldn't get the scanner working. Did critical updates, updated the driver, etc. etc. Nothing worked until I forcibly told it to use what appeared to be the "wrong" driver. Anyway, this experience is a ritual at Mom and Dad's. This, however, is nothing compared to this <a href="http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/stories/2002/09/15/onBeingTheDigitalJob.html">series of technical disasters</a>. I hate computers.
