A month ago, terrorists crashed planes into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a field in Pennsylvania. I didn't post anything about this when it happened because I didn't really know what to think or how to react. I still can't really get my head around the crashes as actual events: I saw them happen on TV, not in real life.

Anyway, my moratorium on "America Strikes Back" links is over.

All they are saying is <a href="http://www.indymedia.org:8081/peace/">give peace a chance</a>.
