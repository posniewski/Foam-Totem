So far (up into epsilon level) solving them isn't too hard, but getting all the stars (basically minimizing the number of construction elements) has escaped me on some of them.\n\n(I've been playing in on my tablet while sitting on my couch with the dog and watching an Indiana Jones marathon.

So far (up into epsilon level) solving them isn't too hard, but getting all the stars (basically minimizing the number of construction elements) has escaped me on some of them.\n\n(I've been playing in on my tablet while sitting on my couch with the dog and watching an Indiana Jones marathon. So today's pretty good.)",
