Huh? The Wall Street Journal has <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118436667045766268.html">an article celebrating the 10 year anniversary of blogging</a>. It cites Jorn's Dec 1997 post "I decided to start my own webpage logging the best stuff I find as I surf, on a daily basis" as the advent.

I'm sure that I'm the two billionth person to say that web logging must be older than that. Heck, I started Foam Totem in Sep 1997 (see the calendar below), and I was reading Dave Winer and Suck.com long before that. At the time, I didn't consider Foam Totem anything particularly special (though I did write my own content management system as there really weren't any others readily available).
