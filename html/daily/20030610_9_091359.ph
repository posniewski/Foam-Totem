<blockquote>
With dozens of online multiplayer games shown at E3, it can be difficult to choose just one extraordinary title. Actually, no it isn't. Anyone who had the chance to play around with City of Heroes, an upcoming massively-multiplayer superhero-based role-playing game developed by San Jose-based Cryptic Studios, will agree the game serves as a breath of fresh air compared to the rest of the MMORPG flock.
