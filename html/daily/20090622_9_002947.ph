12-year-old Oskar has a problem with bullies, separated parents, an alcoholic father, and no friends. Until, that is, he meets his new neighbor Eli. Eli ("Ellie") is also "more-or-less 12 years old", doesn't eat much solid food, doesn't mind the freezing cold, like puzzles, also has no friends, and for some reason insists on being invited into your house before coming in. Hmmm.

The movie unfolds slowly at first, but at a good pace later on and I don't want to give anything away.

It is a foreign (Swedish) film. I strongly suggest that you use the subtitles rather than the wretchedly acted English dubbing. You'll at least know what their actual emotions are, and the text will let you know the content. There's not a huge amount of dialog, and it's paced slow so you won't be constantly reading.

Go rent it. Now.
