By protesting inside all they do is escalate an already tense situation and give Trump supporters the ability to claim the high road \"We were just trying to hold a peaceful rally and these thugs and instigators came here to cause violence.\" While I do not believe that is totally true, there is enough truth that is provides cover for the supporters.
