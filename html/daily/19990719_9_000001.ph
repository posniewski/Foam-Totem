From Greg Aharonian's patent news newsletter, quoting a usenet article,
quoting Petronius Arbiter ca. 210 BCE:
<blockquote>
We trained hard - but it seemed that every time we were beginning
to form up into teams we were reorganized.  I was to learn later
in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganizing,
and what a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion
of progress while actually producing confusion, inefficiency,
and demoralization.
