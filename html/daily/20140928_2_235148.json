    "message":"Netflix update: BoJack Horseman is this odd animated, adult cartoon bankrolled by Netflix. It's about an anthropomorphic horse who played the father on an entirely stereotypical and hugely successful 80's TV show, \"Horsin' Around\". Once a huge star, he hasn't seen much work since. It's a comedy, but gets blacker and blacker as the series goes on (especially after episode six or so). I liked it overall and recommend it, but don't expect a feel-good series (though there are lots of laughs). It's 12 30-minute episodes, which tells a full story.\n\n(I hear it's been green-lit for another season, which makes no sense to me. The story and pacing were spot-on and it concludes perfectly.)",
