I've <a href="/albums">improved the photo pages</a> by making thumbnails and so on. You might actually like looking at them now, although the quality of the photos has not magically increased.

There is now a permanent link on the left side ("Photos") which brings you there.

I spent a little while doctoring the <a href="/albums/cedarpoint2001/CedarPointCrew.jpg">Cedar Point group photo</a> so that it includes all of us.
