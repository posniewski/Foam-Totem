OK, I watched tonight's episode of the new Fox atrocity: <a href="http://www.allyourtv.com/shows/b/showguidebanzai.html">Banzai!</a> The show is breathtaking in its ability to be <a href="http://www.allyourtv.com/0203season/banzai.html">goofy</a>, wildly <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/banzaitv/">non-PC</a>, and funny all at the same time. Absolutely brilliant. The show is a series of bets with almost entirely random outcomes. Each "bet" is around 3 minutes long and most are usually very silly. If you think one is dumb, just wait a couple minutes and another will be on. And it will be sillier. Anyway, give it a try. It's in that dead zone right after Simpsons. (And it works great under TiVo control as well.)
