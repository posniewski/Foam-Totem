On August 18th, <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2002/30jul_ny40.htm">[Asteroid 2002 NY40]</a> will glide past our planet only 1.3 times farther away than the Moon. If we can get it officially called "Shannon's Asteroid" (in honor of my birthday), I promise not to have it crash into the Earth.
