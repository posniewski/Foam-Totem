So, LazyFB, which phone do I want? (The Nexus 4 doesn't do LTE, which is a bummer... but is it a stopper?)\n\nAnd what's the latest for cell phone plans? I'm grandfathered on the old iPhone plan with no data limit for $80. I barely use it as an actual phone, so minutes don't matter at all but data does.\n\nYour wisdom, please.",
