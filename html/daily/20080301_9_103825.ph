Book review:<br>
<b>Majestrum</b>, Matthew Hughes

Henghis Hapthorn is a private detective in a future which is dominated by logic, reason, and science. Something happened to him on the last case, however, that shows that the universe is moving towards magic, intuition, and coincidence. His secretary/computer has been changed into some kind of familiar with a insatiable craving for expensive fresh fruit, for example. And he seems to have another aspect of himself living in his head arguing that he's too logical. When he is hired to do what appears to be a simple background check, it uncovers deeper mysteries about this change and questions about what Hapthorn should do about it.

A good read. The writing is... droll. Not laugh-out-loud funny, but amusing (especially when he is dealing with what used to be his perfectly subservient computer and is now a lazy, bored, cat-like animal).
