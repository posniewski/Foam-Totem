Yup, that's me over there being obviously overjoyed to be modelling my stylish new glasses.

Since September, I noticed that my eyes were getting tired very quickly. When I started my new job, they would be noticeably tired by noon or so. Yeah, I'm spending a lot of time in front of the monitor, but not more than when I was at Broadcom. (And, yes, I know all the various ways to keep your eyes from getting tired and going bad when at a computer. None of it worked a whole lot.) So, I finally went to an optometrist to have them checked out.

He (and his various machines) declared that I was slightly farsighted and probably had been since I was born. (I guess a lot of people who have "normal"/non-corrected vision are.) So, he prescribed glasses for using the computer and reading and other close things.

In other news, my glaucoma test showed slightly high pressure in my eyes. It's in the "gray area" according to the doctor; I make a repeat visit in 3 months to have it checked again. The doctor said my eyes were not filling up like a water baloon and would not explode. This is something of a relief.

Anyway, my glasses are very weak as far as I can tell (+50,+50, whatever that means). They do make things that are far away blurry. Hopefully they will reduce my eyestrain.
