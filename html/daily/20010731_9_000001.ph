This <a href="http://www.naturalvoices.att.com/demos/index.html">text-to-speech translator from AT&T</a> is simply amazing. You can still tell that a computer is doing it, but it is a great advance over previous stuff I've heard.

It stumbles a bit on a <a href="http:/daily/darkandstormy.wav">snippet of Bulwer-Lytton</a> and it makes <a href="http:/daily/pieceofwork.wav">Shakespeare sound like a press release</a>.
