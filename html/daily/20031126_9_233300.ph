Well, Christmas-time is on its way, so I will torture you with a new color scheme. For your listening pleasure, I have provided Foamy Christmas Radio in both high and low bandwidth forms. It doesn't randomize the play order right now, but I'll get to it eventually.

Tell me if you have any problems with the radio stuff. It's new software which seems to work right. However, some stupid music players have a tough time with the links. Dunno why. Anyway, drop me an email if you're having problems.
