"Writing a Tank Girl novelisation was not how I would have most wanted to 
spend my time, but I needed the money, so I made it into 
<a href="http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/m.millar/down/tank.html">a book</a>
as best as 
I could. [...]

I admit it is not a great piece of literature, but it moves along fairly 
briskly and does give some idea of what Tank Girl was about, which is more 
than can be said for the film."
