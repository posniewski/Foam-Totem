    "message":"As you can tell from my newsfeed filled with arcade and pinball pictures, I went to CA Extreme today. I got there early, which was good. By about 3pm it was starting to get over-crowded for me. I got to play a lot of old favorites: Space Shuttle, Black Knight, Pinbot, Addam's Family, Funhouse, Cyclone, Orbiter 1 (!), and a ton of others. I basically played anything that was open. Missed Twilight Zone, Medieval Madness, and a bunch of the fancy new ones because they were too busy.\n\nAlso arcade games: Star Wars, Major Havoc (Curt - I used to merely suck, now I am intolerably awful), Quantum, Tutankham, Joust, Gauntlet (played with people worse than me- unbelievable), Marble Madness (my skills long gone on that one), and also a bunch of others as they opened. Sadly, no Moon Patrol.\n\n$40 for the day. I probably played more different pinball\/arcade games today than in all of my teenage years together.",

By about 3pm it was starting to get over-crowded for me. I got to play a lot of old favorites: Space Shuttle, Black Knight, Pinbot, Addam's Family, Funhouse, Cyclone, Orbiter 1 (!), and a ton of others. I basically played anything that was open. Missed Twilight Zone, Medieval Madness, and a bunch of the fancy new ones because they were too busy.\n\nAlso arcade games: Star Wars, Major Havoc (Curt - I used to merely suck, now I am intolerably awful), Quantum, Tutankham, Joust, Gauntlet (played with people worse than me- unbelievable), Marble Madness (my skills long gone on that one), and also a bunch of others as they opened. Sadly, no Moon Patrol.\n\n$40 for the day. I probably played more different pinball\/arcade games today than in all of my teenage years together.",
