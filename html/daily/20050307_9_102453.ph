With four days of snowboarding imprinted on various body parts I have learned:
<ul>
<li>Typical rental boards suck. The one I had in Telluride was pretty good, but the more typical one I got at Bear Valley was not. Edges were kinda weak, and the board had it's top edge rounded several times (which means that it's met rocks more than once, most likely).
<li>Typical rental bindings suck. Again, Telluride's were pretty nice, it turns out. I had step-in bindings ("Switch" is the brand name?) at Bear Valley and they weren't nearly as good.
<li>Lean forward on your board. Even if you are careening down the hill and doomed to plow into the rapidly growing trees in front of you. If you lean back, you lose control and will see stars. If you lean forward, you may actually turn or stop before that time.
<li>If you cut you hair short, wear a hat when you are in direct sunlight all day. It burns! It burns! We hates the yellow face! (This may seem obvious, but when you have never even thought about it before...)
<li>It's not fun to fall on icy snow and hear a tiny click/pop in your neck. (No after-effects have been note thus far. I'm hoping it was just air like a cracking knuckle rather than exploding some part of my spine.)
</ul>
