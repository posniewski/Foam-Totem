    "message":"I'm not enjoying Daredevil season 2. I don't mind heroes with dark backgrounds or character flaws. But the Matt Murdoch in (at least the first 6 episodes of the season) is a moron. I like my heroes to be, you know, mostly heroic. I'm old fashioned that way. Plus, the writing felt like the CW (e.g. Arrow); it's just a soap opera with the plot contrivances. And contrivances worn so thin, I was expecting them literally episodes in advance. That said, the overall arc seems good, as well as the fight scenes. (Though I don't forgive the bad wire-work. Come on!)",

But the Matt Murdoch in (at least the first 6 episodes of the season) is a moron. I like my heroes to be, you know, mostly heroic. I'm old fashioned that way. Plus, the writing felt like the CW (e.g. Arrow); it's just a soap opera with the plot contrivances. And contrivances worn so thin, I was expecting them literally episodes in advance. That said, the overall arc seems good, as well as the fight scenes. (Though I don't forgive the bad wire-work. Come on!)",
