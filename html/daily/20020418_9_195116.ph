Frailty is part detective mystery, part horror film, part thriller, and part Lifetime special. An abusive but loving father who is visited by an angel one night who tells him that he and his family are chosen to destroy demons. His two sons are understandably confused when he tells them of their new "job". The older one thinks that his father is mad; the viewpoint of the film is essentially his.

It may come as no surprise that the demons appear like regular people, and they are not treated in entirely Christian fashion by the axe-wielding of God's Hand. Choppa-choppa. Should the son abandon his crazed father, or help in the new family business?

It's a tense movie which I thought was pretty good even though Bill Paxton AND Michael McConaughey are in it. Even with God's Hands hacking away, this isn't a full-on horror film. It's more about the struggle to determine the truth when things aren't as black and white as they seem.
