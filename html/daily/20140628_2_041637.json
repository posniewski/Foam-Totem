I don't like stupid real politics, do I really need stupid fantasy politics?\n* Last Ship: Every possible thing they could have done wrong they did. It's just stupid.\n* Continuum: Hot and cold. Overall, it's watchable.\n* Crossbones: I think we've watched two episodes, and haven't rushed to watch the third or fourth. So... meh.\n* Defiance: Gave up last season.\n* World cup: I wish it was hockey.",
