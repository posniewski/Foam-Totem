I went to the <a href="http://www.battlebots.com">BattleBots championships</a> last night. It was pretty cool. Lesson: don't run into heavy things which spin at hundreds of RPM, you'll get thrown across the ring and into angry circular saw blades. Comedy Central taped it, so you might see me. I was underneath the boom camera, though, so you might not.
