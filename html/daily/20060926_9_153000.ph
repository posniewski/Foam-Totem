Not the graph of CO<sub>2</sub>, but a (misleading) <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2006/09/26/historical_heat.php">graph of the temperature over the last 1.35 million years</a>. It's misleading because the last 150 years are zoomed in on. If drawn on equivalent scale, this graph would indicate that there may be historical precedent for a "hot" Earth (around 425 My ago).
