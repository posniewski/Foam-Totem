Which of these is more random?

The one on the right is more truly random than the one on the left. <a href="http://telescoper.wordpress.com/2009/04/04/points-and-poisson-davril/">You may think you're seeing patterns and lines, but there's no actual structure in there.</a> The picture on the left may be more evenly distributed, but it's not actually random. The brain is built to find pattern and structure everywhere, even if it may not exist.

This has a direct bearing on randomness in games. If you make results truly random, players hate it. They think it's "streaky", "broken", or "unfair". I've found that you need to make results evenly distributed but not predictable. If you don't they show up in your forums with Frankenstein rakes and torches.
