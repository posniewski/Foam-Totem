I just finished A&G, a hand-me-down from rv (from 4th?). It begins as interleaved biographies of Arthur Conan Doyle (doctor and creator of Sherlock Holmes) and George Edalji (solicitor and wrongly accused of livestock mutilation). The second half of the book is about Doyle's crusade to unravel the mystery behind the crimes Eladji has been blamed for and clear his name. Surprisingly, the mystery itself didn't hold my attention as much as the lives of these two men and how they intertwine (or don't).

It's "literature" and Barnes deftly explores what it means to be an Englishman, the purpose of religion, not to mention the Edwardian worldview without being too "literary". I liked it, though I felt that some parts dragged a bit.
