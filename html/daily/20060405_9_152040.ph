My plasma TV is almost dead. For no apparent reason, it has gone a bit dim and the signal is also blown out (which seems an odd combination). It's still viewable, but just barely. So, I call the local NEC Plasmasync 42MP3 fix-it place and they say that they do fix them, but that it's not worth it. It's $1100 minimum since the thing that goes wrong on them is the scanout board and that can only be fixed at the factory instead of in-house.

He said it'd be smarter to just buy a new one (and no, they don't sell them so he wasn't trying scam me that way). He then said that I shouldn't get a plasma, though, and that I should get an LCD instead.

I've owned the TV for about 6 years now. It's not noticable during regular viewing, but during troubleshooting (read: tapping and knocking circuit boards) I had a flat gray signal going into it and noticed the burn-in. The TiVo borders, "Now Playing", and the Sci-Fi channel "bug" were clearly visible. Like I said, not at all noticable during normal use, but the burn-in is there.

Sigh. Now I need to get a new TV. Can I even imagine going back to something less than 42"?
