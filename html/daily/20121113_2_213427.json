Vanderbei (Princeton) and Mark Newman (Department of Physics and Center for the Study of Complex Systems, University of Michigan, http:\/\/www-personal.umich.edu\/~mejn\/election\/2012), and although there is a very interesting blended voting map (Most of the country is some shade of purple, a varied blend of Democrat blue and Republican red) what I really wanted was this blended map with a population density overlay.  Because what really stands out is how red the nation seems to be when you do not take the voting population into account; when you do so many of those vast red mid-west blocks fade into pale pink and lavender (very low population).\n\nSo I created a new map using Mark’s blended voting map based on the actual numbers of votes for each party overlaid with population maps from Texas Tech University and other sources. \n\nHere’s the result—what the American political voting distribution really looks like. UPDATE: Here's the full-sized version of the map: http:\/\/www.saltwaterwitch.com\/img\/WhatAmericaLooksLike-2012Election-ChrisHoward.jpg",
