Media update. Here's my thoughts on recent movies.

<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0245674"><i>13 Ghosts</i></a>: Really great production design, great start, some nice deaths (including a person who gets cut in half vertically from top to bottom-- yeah!), but weak ending and woefully lacking in plot or smarts. Better than <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0229260">Blair Witch 2</a>.

<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120681"><i>From Hell</i></a>: Another visual treat, this time with more of a plot to hang it on. Significant liberties taken with the <a href="http://www.eddiecampbellcomics.com/fromhell/">comic's plot</a>, but only one is really bad (vague due to possible spoilage). Some scene composition taken directly from the comic (including a great time-lapse). Several too many green backlit shadows. Worth matinee prices, may be worth regular price.

<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0139654"><i>Training Day</i></a>: I don't like cop movies as a general rule, but went to <i>Training Day</i> since friends wanted to. The last time I did this it was for either <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0232500"><i>The Fast and Furious</i></a> or <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0246544"><i>The Musketeer</i></a>, so the augury was not positive. But, it was really good. Worth regular price. Go see it if you can handle seeing corrupt and brutal plainsclothes vice cops.

<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0108148"><i>Iron Monkey</i></a>: Walk out your door now, get in your car, and go see this movie. It's got great fights, a good plot, just the right touch of campiness, and is a lot of fun.

<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0261392"><i>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</i></a>: If you like any of Kevin Smith's movies (Clerks, Chasing Amy, Dogma) go see this movie. It's a romp using the characters from all of them and is just generally a good time. If you don't know these movies, don't bother, though.
