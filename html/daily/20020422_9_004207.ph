Arrrgggghhh! The Foam Totem OS boot disk died this weekend and I spent much of what remained trying to get a functioning server again. Since the OS disk died, all the config files (like user info, firewall, dhcpd, samba, etc.) were missing. There are still some things not quite right, but it mostly works.

If you don't think there are people out there trying to hack your server, you are 284% wrong. I had re-installed the operating system and was re-creating the firewall chains when I was attacked (successfully). I think I had my machine vaguely open (creating configs, testing them, tweaking them, defaults on ftp, ssh, etc.) for about an hour. That's all it took. They had trojaned one of my config files, so when I did a reboot... bleah.

Anyway, the hack was insidious enough that I had to reinstall all over again. Feh. Luckily, the web site's content (including all third party content) is on a newer disk and was unscathed.

Currently not working: Automatic picture albums (my and rv pictures). I've closed telnet and ftp access until I'm sure what hole they got in. I think it was an ftp hole. (Anonymous/guest access was when things went bad.)

The one good piece of news out of this is that I have no officially retired my ancient (1995) Gateway. I'm now using an old (1998?) Dell Pentium II. The march of progress!
