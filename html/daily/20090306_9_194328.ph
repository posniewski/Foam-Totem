The long-awaited adaptation of the famous 80s comic is finally released. And it's good. Purists will take umbrage at several things in <i>Watchmen</i>. There are nuances of the various characters which are different in the movie than they are in the comic. And, as is well known, there is no giant squid monster at the end. These purists should shut up.

On its own, it's stands well. Most superficially, it's a whodunnit. There's a whole lot more going on, though. It's also a dark and grim exploration of the ends justifying the means. And the purpose of justice. And why or if people should really care about this stuff.

Just as <i>Watchmen</i> isn't really a superhero comic, this isn't a superhero movie. Sure it's got capes and fight scenes, but the gray areas it explores keep it from being your typical good guy-bad guy story. It's gory and brutal at times. Expect character flaws. Choices aren't always entirely right or wrong. Endings aren't always entirely happy or sad.

Oh: And expect a glowing blue wang in good many scenes.
