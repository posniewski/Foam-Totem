I've been spending insomniac hours playing <a href="http://weboggle.shackworks.com/"><img border=0 src="http://weboggle.shackworks.com/images/boggle.png"></a>.

I've been playing the 4x4 puzzle and I usually finish at or just below the middle of the players. A lot of the words are not Scrabble safe, so that takes some getting used to.

Cool stuff they did: click a name in the rankings and the words they found that you didn't are highlighted. Put your cursor over a word and it highlights the people who found the word. Click a word and it goes to the dictionary definition.

I play as "foamy".
