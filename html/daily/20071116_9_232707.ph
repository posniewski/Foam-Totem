For those who don't know, <a href="http://www.crypticstudios.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=161&Itemid=31">Cryptic sold <i>Cities</i> to NCSoft</a>. The entire live development team for <i>Cities</i> now works for NCSoft. They are still in the building for a while, even, so the change shouldn't be too disruptive on the game itself.

It's bittersweet, as you might imagine. They gave us money. We gave them full ownership of the game and IP.
