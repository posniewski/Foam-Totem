I think I've linked to <a href="http://www.kpr.ku.edu/retro.html">The Retro Cocktail Hour</a> before, but if you want the smooth, swinging, and sometimes saccharine sounds of the 50's and 60's it the best place to go. A <a href="http://www.kpr.ku.edu/retro/retrolisten.htm">new show every week</a>! Depending on the week I find about 50% of it a little too cheesy for even my palate, but the rest is pure gold.
