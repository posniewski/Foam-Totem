<div class="title">Haloscan: RIP</div>

Haloscan, the nifty web service I've been using here on Foam Totem to handle comments, is giving up the ghost. I paid for a lifetime membership a bunch of years ago since it was was easy to use and just flat-out worked. Haloscan recently got bought up by <a href="http://js-kit.com/">JS-Kit</a> who has now decided to discontinue supporting Haloscan entirely. They have automatically switched me over to "Echo", their new system. Imagine my surprise that it now costs a yearly fee.

So, now I'm looking into other free (as in beer) commenting systems. The top contenders are <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> and <a href="http://intensedebate.com">Intense Debate</a>. Neither of them are trivial ports, though. Bleh.
