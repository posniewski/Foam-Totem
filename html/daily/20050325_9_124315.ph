<a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001259.html">A look at the recent Social Security Trustee's report:</a>
<blockquote>
[A] permanent tax increase of 1.2 percent of GDP would offset the Social Security gap, forever and ever and ever. In FY2006 dollars, that would be $155 billion. By contrast, the cost of the tax cuts since 2000 in the same terms is 2.2 percent of GDP (Auerbach, Gale and Orszag, 2004). So eliminating 55 percent of the Bush tax cuts offsets the Social Security shortfall over the infinite horizon.
