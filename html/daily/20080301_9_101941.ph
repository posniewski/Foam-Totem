Book Review:<br>
<b>Ring</b>, Stephen Baxter

Baxter is a repeat author for me, though at the moment I can't remember why. His <i>Manifold:...</i> (<i>Manifold:Space</i>, <i>Manifold:Time</i>, etc.) series revolved around a main character I entirely disliked, yet I read them anyway for some reason. So the books couldn't have been all bad. By comparison, I found myself unable to finish Kim Stanley Robinson's <i>Red Mars</i> because I hated the protagonist so much.

<i>Ring</i> is "hard" SF, so if you're looking for deep characters you're not going to find them. The novel covers an enormous span of time, and is about big ideas and the eventual fate of the universe (and perhaps about the birth of a new one). As a "big idea" book, Baxter does a lot of science exposition, so if that's not your bag give this one a pass. Overall, I liked it. It's not often you read a book about enemies shooting entire galaxies at each other.
