    "message":"Dropped my Nexus 7 about two feet this morning and it landed pretty softly, I thought. Glass cracked, screen works, but the touch screen doesn't work. This sucks for several reasons. The main one is that it costs between $110 and $170 bucks to replace. On a $250 device. (I can get a new one with 8GB for $200.) A lesser reason is that there's no way for me to wipe it (as far as I can tell) since I can't interact with it.\n\nThe glass on the Nexus 7 is terrible. Within a month of owning it, I had scratches on it. I don't use kid gloves on these things, but I'm not abusive at all. Today's catastrophic drop was really quite mild.",

This sucks for several reasons. The main one is that it costs between $110 and $170 bucks to replace. On a $250 device. (I can get a new one with 8GB for $200.) A lesser reason is that there's no way for me to wipe it (as far as I can tell) since I can't interact with it.\n\nThe glass on the Nexus 7 is terrible. Within a month of owning it, I had scratches on it. I don't use kid gloves on these things, but I'm not abusive at all. Today's catastrophic drop was really quite mild.",
