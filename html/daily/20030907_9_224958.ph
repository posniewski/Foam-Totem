Foam Totem has done a server switch-over. It's in an old Stellar computer: PII, 512MB RAM, lots more disk space (2x200GB disks, mirrored so we have 200 GB of user space), new OS (Debian Linux).

I had to recreate all the users, so all the passwords have been reset. I also had to recreate the permissions on your files. If something seems amiss, that's probably why.

If you see anything out of place or not working, drop me an email.
