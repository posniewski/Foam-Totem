Up until now, I've used Foam Totem for things which I think readers (all three of you) will find interesting. A lot of people are using them more like diaries, and I'm going to start doing so as well. Don't worry! No deep, pretentious, inner-most-thoughts stuff is likely. I mean more stuff on what I'm interested in now, things I'm researching, and so on. It'll be geekier. And no one will care in the slightest about what I'm writing, but I'm writing it for myself rather than for anyone else.
