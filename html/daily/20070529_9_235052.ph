Meh. The third, and hopefully very last, episode of Pirates is even messier than the last one. There's simply too much going on (or the director is incapable of keeping the various threads clear).

For example, there are two buffoonish British sidekicks who guard Davy Jones' heart. They later do a pratfall to escape the British ship. Then later, they seem to be Pirates. Why? When did that happen? Plus, there are so many characters, that I'm not even sure it was those guys who were those pirates. These guys added nothing to the movie; it is already packed with 100 other incidental characters.

It is possible that a better director (or maybe writer) would have been able to keep all these characters clear.

It's a fun romp and all that. I think it would have been better if it had been edited down to 2.5 hours. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086879/">"Too many notes."</a>
