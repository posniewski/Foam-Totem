Amazingly, I still get Wired magazine. (It's worth the $1 an issue I pay for it.) Anyway, there's a puff piece on Peter Jackson's new King Kong movie which has a recent picture of Jackson in it. <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.10/kingkong.html">He's almost unrecognizable after losing 70 lbs and having his sight fixed.</a>

In addition, he's been doing a <a href="http://www.kongisking.net/kong2005/proddiary/">weekly video diary</a> for the length of the production. It's quite cool.
