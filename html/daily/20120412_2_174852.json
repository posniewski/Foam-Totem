(When they described Witness, I immediately thought that it sounded an awful lot like Myst, too.) I think I am most irritated by the author's lack of knowledge in the field and uncritical worship of JB. What Jon Blow says he's trying to do is interesting, but he's far from the only person doing \"serious\" games (a recent one being Dear Esther, for example). And his major success could easily be ascribed to novel gameplay rather than a nearly impenetrable narrative. The fact that no one seems to get what the game was \"about\" might indicate an author's inability to communicate well rather than some deeper meaning that we are all too stupid to figure out.",

(When they described Witness, I immediately thought that it sounded an awful lot like Myst, too.) I think I am most irritated by the author's lack of knowledge in the field and uncritical worship of JB. What Jon Blow says he's trying to do is interesting, but he's far from the only person doing \"serious\" games (a recent one being Dear Esther, for example). And his major success could easily be ascribed to novel gameplay rather than a nearly impenetrable narrative. The fact that no one seems to get what the game was \"about\" might indicate an author's inability to communicate well rather than some deeper meaning that we are all too stupid to figure out.",
