<a href="http://www.foamtotem.org/~radio/christmas.pls">[high bandwidth]</a>
There's a fairly arbitrary mix of stuff on there, so it might be heavy on one thing or another. If you have any specific stuff (include artist) which you want on there (or anything you hate you want yanked), <a href="mailto:radio@foamtotem.org">drop me a line</a>.

Also, the low bandwidth version is being generated as I post this. It won't be done for a couple hours.
