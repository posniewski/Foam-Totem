It's June and a long time since the last update.

Obviously, I'm back from E3. It went great and City of Villains showed very well. The press was very excited about being able to build your own Lair, which is cool since I think our fans will really like it.

This is the summer of excessive air travel for me. E3 was in LA. I went to Ohio for Memorial Day (tragically missing the construction of the <a href="/daily/ttbridge.jpg">Twin Trees Bridge</a>). I'm off to downstate New York for a wedding this weekend. And then to upstate New York for 4th of July.

I'm guessing that's about 14,000 miles in a month and a half. And none of them on the same airline. Sigh.
