I watched the 3rd season premiere of <i>Heroes</i>: "Hiro meets the Carnies". I watched all of last season even when most sane people had given up on it. The end end of last season was pretty good. I had heard that they had changed up the writers again to try and bring back what made the first season of Heroes so good, so I was fairly hopeful.

But, alas, "Meh" is the best I can give it. Two hours long, I was bored after the first ten minutes. As always, as soon as Hiro is on, the show is fun, mysterious, and cool. But put any Patrelli or Parkman on the screen and it's a huge snooze.

I think they gave up an interesting twist plot already by having Syler show up. They should have treated "Nathan" as Nathan until we all forgot about it. Say, seven episodes in. Then bring Syler back in, if you feel you really must. Frankly, I would have truly killed Syler as a character and just have the new Nathan take on aspects of his personality as he finds out he has more powers than before.

I had a lot more fun imagining and writing that paragraph than I did watching the episode.
