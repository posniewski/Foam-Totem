MapInfo's <a href="http://cdc.mapinfo.com/webapp/countrymap.asp?level=County&poi=1989-1998&cod=Traumatic%20Brain%20Injury&colors=Red,%20Blue,%20Gray,%20White%20(4%20colors)">MapXtreme shreds on Traumatic Brain Injuries</a> across the US. It's EXTREME!

(It doesn't appear as if the State Injury maps work. And they're using the one of the worst possible projections (Mercator?!) for the U.S. map. And it's slow. Have I mentioned that I still hold some <a href="http://clearstation.etrade.com/cgi-bin/details?Symbol=maps">MapInfo stock</a>? And that it's at just over $3.00 right now?)
