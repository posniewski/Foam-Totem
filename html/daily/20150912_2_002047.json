    "message":"Divi managed to split open her stitches this morning. She had tugged them somehow on Sunday at some point, and the vet and I thought she had tightened them or something. He removed the excess dangling suture. I'm pretty sure they actually came loose somehow and the cut was being held closed with the surgical adhesive. She was sleeping on my bed when I got out of the shower, and the incision was wide open; that's pretty gross, by the way. I butterfly bandaged it shut and luckily the vet was able to take her right away and restitched it.\n\nSo, that was exciting. She's doing fine, though this basically hit the reset button on the recovery of the wound. I was supposed to start short walks tomorrow; not any more.",

He removed the excess dangling suture. I'm pretty sure they actually came loose somehow and the cut was being held closed with the surgical adhesive. She was sleeping on my bed when I got out of the shower, and the incision was wide open; that's pretty gross, by the way. I butterfly bandaged it shut and luckily the vet was able to take her right away and restitched it.\n\nSo, that was exciting. She's doing fine, though this basically hit the reset button on the recovery of the wound. I was supposed to start short walks tomorrow; not any more.",
