I'm back from the Christmas break. I'm going to leave the foamy music up for a bit longer as I'm not quite ready to let the holidays go.

Travel went fine and on time, more or less. TSA opened all my luggage and pawed through it. (I hope they enjoyed all my dirty clothes. Man, that job must suck. I'd want to wear a hazmat suit.)
