I'm also waiting for Bob to do some more computational demonology. I really wish he'd get back to the business of churning out novels with so many big ideas that they make my head hurt.\n\nPaolo Bacigalupi is an author who IMO does a nice job of juggling both YA and A writing - if anything, I feel like he brings the YA stuff up a notch instead of taking the A down. This has been much appreciated by a clever kid or two who I've turned on to his books. He's been pretty busy on the YA front recently though.",

Not life-changing, but enjoyable, and the tech stuff is very well done.\n\nSimilar feelings about \"Nexus\" by Ramez Naam - he does a pretty respectable job with the tech, and the book's enjoyable enough. I didn't find it anywhere near as ground-breaking as others seem to have, but I did enjoy it.\n\nBut basically I'm still on the hunt for more swing-for-the-fences, overly ambitious space opera, and there's not enough of that happening right now.\n\nI'm hoping that \"On the Steel Breeze\" by Alastair Reynolds picks up the momentum that took so long to get established in \"Blue Remembered Earth\". When he's on, he can be really good. You might also want to check out Peter Watts if you haven't already. Clearly a deeply intelligent dude, and I've like the stuff I've read by him.",

    "message":"Book rant incoming...\n\nI thought both \"Wool\" and \"The Martian\" were fine, but neither were amazing works. The plots were fine, but I felt the language in both was bland, simple, and by-the-numbers. Many have been lavishing those books with high praise, and I just don't see it. I've also felt the same sort of twinge regarding Charlie Stross' last couple Laundry novels. And I liked Steelheart, but it was also simple (of course, that's a YA title so maybe I got what I paid for).\n\nI also note that I've been reading these as ebooks rather than paper books and I wonder if that is coloring my perception of the writing itself. I'm not a terribly discerning reader; I don't need my genre fiction to be \"Literature\" (whatever that might be). But I feel like something is missing.\n\nAnother possibility is that many of my favorite authors are writing YA now (instead of \"Adult\") fiction and it affects all their work. In the abstract, I don't mind this as I don't require taboo topics and themes (sex, graphic violence, four-letter words) in my reading. But I wonder if authors are also pulling back on the structure of and language in their books as well. If so, I think that's a mistake; I didn't need my books dumbed down structurally when I was a teen.\n\nRelated: I'm looking for suggestions for some recent-ish scifi to read. Any suggestions?\n\n(I should note that the writing in the Wool series improved markedly by the last book.)",

I'm also waiting for Bob to do some more computational demonology.

This has been much appreciated by a clever kid or two who I've turned on to his books. He's been pretty busy on the YA front recently though.",

The plots were fine, but I felt the language in both was bland, simple, and by-the-numbers. Many have been lavishing those books with high praise, and I just don't see it. I've also felt the same sort of twinge regarding Charlie Stross' last couple Laundry novels. And I liked Steelheart, but it was also simple (of course, that's a YA title so maybe I got what I paid for).\n\nI also note that I've been reading these as ebooks rather than paper books and I wonder if that is coloring my perception of the writing itself. I'm not a terribly discerning reader; I don't need my genre fiction to be \"Literature\" (whatever that might be). But I feel like something is missing.\n\nAnother possibility is that many of my favorite authors are writing YA now (instead of \"Adult\") fiction and it affects all their work. In the abstract, I don't mind this as I don't require taboo topics and themes (sex, graphic violence, four-letter words) in my reading. But I wonder if authors are also pulling back on the structure of and language in their books as well. If so, I think that's a mistake; I didn't need my books dumbed down structurally when I was a teen.\n\nRelated: I'm looking for suggestions for some recent-ish scifi to read. Any suggestions?\n\n(I should note that the writing in the Wool series improved markedly by the last book.)",
