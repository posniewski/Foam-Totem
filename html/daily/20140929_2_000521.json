    "message":"TV Update:\nGotham was pretty good, I thought.\nDracula and The Tomorrow People were both canceled, apparently. I'm not torn up.\nI am bummed that Almost Human was canned. The fact the The Last Ship was renewed doesn't help.\nI hope The Strain kicks it into gear. I'm afraid they have an extra character or two slowing down the proceedings.\nI find myself wondering if I even care if Castle is dead or not. Of course he isn't, but you get my point.\nThe break drained Agents of SHIELD of huge momentum and excitement it had at the end of the last season. The first episode didn't quite get the motor running.\nI really liked Haven. And then last season:ugh. And this one is doubling down on ugh, it seems.",

I'm afraid they have an extra character or two slowing down the proceedings.\nI find myself wondering if I even care if Castle is dead or not. Of course he isn't, but you get my point.\nThe break drained Agents of SHIELD of huge momentum and excitement it had at the end of the last season. The first episode didn't quite get the motor running.\nI really liked Haven. And then last season:ugh. And this one is doubling down on ugh, it seems.",
