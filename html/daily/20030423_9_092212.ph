I am not a gambler. The only gambling I've done has been in the giant government-sanctioned casino of the stock market. I have gotten nothing but screwed for it. Every time it appears that I might hit a minor jackpot, events seem to conspire against me.

I had lingering stock options at Broadcom which I had to exercise by 17 April (90 days after leaving the company). A bunch at 8-something and a bunch at 15.75. The stock was at 14 the day before my deadline. It had been fluctuating around the 14 mark for a while, so I cashed in the 8s. The next day, I was excited that the stock jumped a bit. It was at 16.50 and suddenly my worthless 15.75 options weren't underwater. I sold them; it was the last day they were viable. It wasn't worth much, but something is better than nothing.

So today the stock is at 18.50, which means I would have made more than triple what I did on the 15s. It ties my stomach in knots. Dammit! Is there any way I'm going to make back the $150,000+ AMT screwage from momentary paper gains <i>I am never going to realize</i>?!

It's been three years since the AMT debacle and thinking about it fills me with rage. I may never forgive the government for stealing all my savings.

What bothers me most about this is that I am upset about any of it. The only reason I care is because of Greed; I want that money. And wanting it makes me sick.
