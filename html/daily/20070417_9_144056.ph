Quicky Review:

Loved Rodruiguez' Planet Terror: tastelessly gory, funny, sexy, goofy, and earnest. Didn't like Tarantino's Death Proof: pointless, uninspired, and boring. Where Planet Terror felt like a real movie (if a grade-B splatterfest), Death Proof just felt like Tarantino shot film until he drank his six-pack and then just went with whatever crap he had.

Anyway, I didn't feel angry about the 7 bucks but you might take a tip from my Mom and sneak off to another movie when Death Proof starts. :-)
