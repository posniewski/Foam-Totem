Even with Rotten Tomatoes giving this an 18%, we went to see Max Payne. It wasn't all bad. In fact, I rather liked the first 2/3 of the movie or so. Detective Max Payne is looking for the person who killed his wife and kid three years previously. (And, of course, breaking some heads along the way.) He finally gets a solid lead and begins a vengeance campaign. Which is where the wheels start to come off the movie.

There's a character who quips "You know what I do for a living, don't you?" Well, I don't, actually. She shows up later on during the climax for no apparent reason, doesn't do anything particularly important, and then just vanishes again. There are couple things like this in the third act which unhinge the movie. I suspect that important plot elements were cut to get the movie down to a PG-13 (or shorten it).

I liked the overall style of the movie, though, and the more "supernatural" things Max sees are done well. It hit the pitch that <b><i>Constantine</i></b> failed at.

I'd be hard-pressed to recommend even a matinee. If you're at the theater looking for something to watch, it's not an awful choice.
