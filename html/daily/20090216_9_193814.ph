A thriller/chiller about a seemingly normal Businessman of the Year whose terrible secret is that he's a serial killer. He doesn't really want to be one and attends AA meetings to try to keep it in control. After one of his double murders, a voyeur confronts him with photos, blackmailing Mr. Brooks into taking him on his next murder. Sounds a bit like <i>Dexter</i>, doesn't it? 

I won't tell any more for fear that it will let more out than I should. There are subplots which I thought were superfluous that aren't if I had been paying attention rather than falling asleep on the couch.

Rental recommended. It's not too scary or gory. The killing in this movie (ABOUT A MURDERER) is in the low single digits. Compare to <i>Taken</i> which was well into double digits. Discuss.
