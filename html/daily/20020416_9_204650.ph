<a href="http://progressquest.com/hi.php?name=Dextromethorphan">Progress Quest update: Now at 34! <font size="1">(updated 18 Apr)</font> (65th Level)</a> It appears that I rotate from low rankings (I've seen it as low as the mid-30s) to the mid-200s. I think that it re-ranks you only when you level and when you do so it puts you at the top of the heap. So you slowly move down the list until you level (which now takes weeks).
