Instead they protect an obvious aggregation of previous invention or a change of domain. For an example of the latter: Do \"X\" on a computer, or do \"X\" via the internet, where \"X\" is something like \"sell clothing\". The purpose of patenting is to advance the state of the art; the mechanism is to provide a limited-time monopoly. I think a lot of people skip to the mechanism, awarding inventors, and forget that there's supposed to be a novel advancement.\n\nI should make a business patent which says that one can compose any transaction with \"Do <transaction> on the internet\/computer\" to make a new patentable transaction.\n\nI *said* it was crazy.",

To the extent that we stifle new creation by maintaining monopolies on old creations ad infinitum-- regardless of how much money those rights make the holder-- we are working against its charter. It is demonstrably untrue that we need long copyright terms to foster creativity. (Ironically, Disney is a prime example. He created all the Disney classics with much much shorter terms.) One could make a case that long terms stagnates creativity, not just be reducing cultural reuse, but by removing incentives for existing rights-holders to create anything new. Instead, they work on leveraging and protecting their existing rights.\n\nI appear to have ranted. Whoops.",

Instead they protect an obvious aggregation of previous invention or a change of domain. For an example of the latter: Do \"X\" on a computer, or do \"X\" via the internet, where \"X\" is something like \"sell clothing\". The purpose of patenting is to advance the state of the art; the mechanism is to provide a limited-time monopoly. I think a lot of people skip to the mechanism, awarding inventors, and forget that there's supposed to be a novel advancement.\n\nI should make a business patent which says that one can compose any transaction with \"Do <transaction> on the internet\/computer\" to make a new patentable transaction.\n\nI *said* it was crazy.",

To the extent that we stifle new creation by maintaining monopolies on old creations ad infinitum-- regardless of how much money those rights make the holder-- we are working against its charter. It is demonstrably untrue that we need long copyright terms to foster creativity. (Ironically, Disney is a prime example. He created all the Disney classics with much much shorter terms.) One could make a case that long terms stagnates creativity, not just be reducing cultural reuse, but by removing incentives for existing rights-holders to create anything new. Instead, they work on leveraging and protecting their existing rights.\n\nI appear to have ranted. Whoops.",
