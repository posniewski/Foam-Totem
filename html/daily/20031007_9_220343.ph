Someone shoot me. Schwarzenegger is now governor of California. Absolute insanity.

I just don't understand why there was so much "voter disgust" (as the AP put it) with Davis. We elected him less than a year ago. There was no funny business with the original election. Nothing odd. No scandals. No need for the Supreme Court to decide the election, for example. What the hell are the people of this state thinking? It just flat-out baffles me.

Oh yeah, I'm just estatic about having a raging Republican with no experience (except in sexual battery) as my governor. Feh.
