<img src="/daily/images/20081219_9_172410-photo.jpg" border="0" align="right"/> Here's a quick snap of my injury. I've kept it clean and slathered with 
antibiotic ointment so it looks really good. It doesn't hurt or
anything, but I keep the bandage on so I don't accidentally turn my 
finger into a Pez container.
