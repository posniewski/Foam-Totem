Years ago, the Republicans came up with the epithet "Tax and Spend Liberal", which they used to paint pretty much any Democrat regardless of their fiscal proclivities. Considering the current policy of cutting taxes (largely for those who don't need them cut) and vast spending (for the war, for social programs they promised, and pork for interests they are beholden to) I think a label is needed to brand candidates which support such silliness.

"Pawn and Spend Republican" is a good one, I think. 

I rather like "Spend and Pray Republican" too. Pray that someone will be able to pay for it later on. Pray that the Iraq somehow magics itself "fixed". Pray that the heathens will reject evolution...

Ideas?
