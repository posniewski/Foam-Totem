I thought that the first episode of Joss Whedon's (Buffy) new sci-Fi series <a href="http://www.fox.com/firefly/">Firefly</a> was pretty good. It's sort of like Wild, Wild West with Han Solo and in reverse (they're actually in the future at the edge of known space, which has an uncanny resemblance to the dusty American frontier). (Do I perhaps detect a bit of borrowing from <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0213338">Cowboy Bebop</a> as well?) Try it out.
