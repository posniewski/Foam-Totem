The other thing is that those with college degrees earn more money than those who don't.  You can find this information on the u.s. labor dept. website (i have looked it up in the past but am too lazy at the moment to link here).  So, knowing that, why wouldn't one get a degree?  (I am an anomaly as until recently I didn't have a degree and earned six figures - but i'm in the computer field, which is probably where you see this anomaly more frequently).  State schools are great.  Umass Lowell offers free tuition for community college transfers if they went to one of the state community colleges and maintained a 3.0, for example.  Not the \"conventional\" way to get into a four year college, but definitely has been for many people (comm -> four year).  But yes, to pay that much money when you aren't even sure what you want to do.....  finally, there are some careers where a college degree doesn't matter and you can make good money (e.g. plumber, electrician, etc.).  Melissa - tell your kids that Jack Welch went to a state school (UMASS) and if any of them are football fans, the current NFL commissioner went to a UMASS school.  :)"

They went to private schools, often to obtain degrees with poor employment prospects, often for more than four years, took out significant loans for living expenses, and often did not even work summers. Yeah, it sucks to be saddled with lifelong debt because you made bad decisions at age 18. But should the guy who went into the military because he was smart enough to know he couldn't otherwise afford school then have to further subsidize the years you spent throwing pots and reading Proust?"

Explicitly including that statement (perhaps with amortization figures, to show how many years it will take them to pay off their loans at that expected salary?) should prevent that at least.\n\nI do feel for current\/ recent graduates; when I graduated even sociology majors could get jobs.

You'd think that it would pay for lenders to try to educate those they lend to about their obligations. I think they would do so if there were actual risk in taking uninformed people onto their liabilities line.\n\nStudent loan \"forgiveness\" doesn't have to come from the taxpayer. For typical loans, lenders are not bailed out by with tax dollars when someone can't pay what they owe. That said, one could easily believe that if there were debt forgiveness, that the gov't would be pressed very hard by the finance industry to cough up cash. It certainly did so in 2008.\n\nI'd also like to see a new WPA. It seems like win-win to me, but the pessimism and jadedness of people regarding \"big government\" makes it seem like a non-starter."

Secondly, how can anyone go into so much debt with their eyes open?

The other thing is that those with college degrees earn more money than those who don't.  You can find this information on the u.s. labor dept. website (i have looked it up in the past but am too lazy at the moment to link here).  So, knowing that, why wouldn't one get a degree?  (I am an anomaly as until recently I didn't have a degree and earned six figures - but i'm in the computer field, which is probably where you see this anomaly more frequently).  State schools are great.  Umass Lowell offers free tuition for community college transfers if they went to one of the state community colleges and maintained a 3.0, for example.  Not the \"conventional\" way to get into a four year college, but definitely has been for many people (comm -> four year).  But yes, to pay that much money when you aren't even sure what you want to do.....  finally, there are some careers where a college degree doesn't matter and you can make good money (e.g. plumber, electrician, etc.).  Melissa - tell your kids that Jack Welch went to a state school (UMASS) and if any of them are football fans, the current NFL commissioner went to a UMASS school.  :)"

For typical loans, lenders are not bailed out by with tax dollars when someone can't pay what they owe. That said, one could easily believe that if there were debt forgiveness, that the gov't would be pressed very hard by the finance industry to cough up cash. It certainly did so in 2008.\n\nI'd also like to see a new WPA. It seems like win-win to me, but the pessimism and jadedness of people regarding \"big government\" makes it seem like a non-starter."
