My hero, Iwan Axt, is again raising money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society by training for and participating in the Gulf Coast Half Ironman. He did this event three years ago for the Society not knowing anyone that was affected by these diseases and found they were more prevalent in his near social group than he thought. This time he has a very personal reason for racing and raising money for the Society: four friends.
