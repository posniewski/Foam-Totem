This is a great horror/zombie movie. There's a lot of great dialog, and the script is entirely deadpan; no winking, nudging, or other deconstruction is done. It's often very funny even though (or maybe because) it's played straight. Stars Nathan Fillion (of Firefly) as the small-town sherrif that all such movies seem to have. 

If you like zombie or "gross" movies at all, go see it. (It's not particularly scary.)
