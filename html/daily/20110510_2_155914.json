Doing that would basically ruin the fun social aspect that it had. And since Facebook now \"rolls up\" multiple entries from the same app into a big chunk that you must expand to see, I'm worried that they're going to get lost entirely. (They did this with all Twitter entries and basically made them 10 times less visible.)\n\nI doubt they're doing it on purpose, of course, but Facebook is steadily reducing my interaction (reducing and complicating the \"flow\") by bundling these things up."
