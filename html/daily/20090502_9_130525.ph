This is the new grindhouse. Puerile. Willfully stupid. Gory. Politically incorrect. Boobs, blood, and butts. There's nothing left unexploited that I can think of except perhaps Nazis and Nuns. It's pornographic. To the point that there's a scene with a mob of porn industry vets.

It's also very silly and knows it. And that's what keeps the movie from being disgusting garbage. Don't take anything you see seriously, because the movie sure as hell doesn't.

For those following the gripping drama of Chev Chelios might remember that he was falling a half mile from a helicopter at the end of the last movie. A few short seconds later, Chelios smashes and bounces off of a car. Somehow alive, he is instantly picked up in a black van by the Triad and has his heart replaced with an artificial, battery-powered heart. As he tries to get back his real heart, he needs to charge up occasionally, which he does in a number of increasingly more insane ways.

Saying any more would pretty much mean I spent more time typing this than it took to watch the movie.

So: it's the new grindhouse, and it's good. Like it or don't. It doesn't care.
