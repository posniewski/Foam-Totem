    "message":"Did the Disney Backstage Magic tour today. About 50% cool and 50% fluff. Underneath\/behind the American Adventure watching the sets silently and automatically move around was very cool. Visited the nursery and saw where the topiaries are made. Went to Animal Kingdom to talk to a cast member, for reasons? Walked through the costuming building, which felt like a weird invasion of private space. Visited Utilidor tunnels under Magic Kingdom, which were simultaneously neat and entirely mundane. Scandalously saw Sleeping Beauty out of her (full) dress. Visited a giant manufacturing building where they were fabricating ride cars, jungle animals, signage, giant Indy-crushing boulders, and huffable paint fumes. A good time overall.\n\nI would have preferred a more engineering-oriented tour, but then I suspect many in the group would not have. (And the guides were not equipped to handle such a thing.)",

Underneath\/behind the American Adventure watching the sets silently and automatically move around was very cool. Visited the nursery and saw where the topiaries are made. Went to Animal Kingdom to talk to a cast member, for reasons? Walked through the costuming building, which felt like a weird invasion of private space. Visited Utilidor tunnels under Magic Kingdom, which were simultaneously neat and entirely mundane. Scandalously saw Sleeping Beauty out of her (full) dress. Visited a giant manufacturing building where they were fabricating ride cars, jungle animals, signage, giant Indy-crushing boulders, and huffable paint fumes. A good time overall.\n\nI would have preferred a more engineering-oriented tour, but then I suspect many in the group would not have. (And the guides were not equipped to handle such a thing.)",
