Panic Room is a deadly game of cat and mouse. The set is perfect. The acting and pacing is perfect. The characters and the script are perfect. The movie as a whole has this <a href="http://www.lileks.com/institute/gallery/10PM/3.html">glossy sheen of perfection like food in a 1950's cookbook</a>.

Which is why I liked it, but also felt somehow cheated when it was over. The movie is solid; like I said, everything is done well. Fincher is a great director; his now-trademark impossible CGI-enhanced camera movements didn't even seem gimmicky at the time. The movie just failed to provide anything which really grabbed me.

A good movie solidly done, but no more. Matinee fare.
