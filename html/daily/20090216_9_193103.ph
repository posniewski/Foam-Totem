This movie was awful. Not <i>Eks Vs. Sever</i> awful, but pretty awful. Netflix had this at a 3.0 rating so I figured I'd try it out. It wasn't until this moment that I looked up the IMDB and Rot ratings. Damn you Netflix!

The movie was sort of OK (though slow) until the third act, where it stopped making any kind of sense at all.

Avoid. Not worth a Netflix rental.
