Set up of <a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/t/tiamat.html">Tiamat</a>, the computer serving up Foam Totem, is nearly complete. In celebration, I have gone back to the warm color scheme. (Other computer names at home are <a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/e/enki.html">Enki</a> and <a href="http://www.half-mind.com/who.htm">OnOn</a>.)

FTP and telnet are available again (and I figured how to get rid of that irritating 30 second wait when FTP-ing). Passwords have been reset. I will be sending temporary passwords to users soon.
