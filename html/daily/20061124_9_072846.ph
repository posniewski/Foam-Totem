A thiller with a just a wafting hint of sci-fi. A terrorist blows up a ferry in New Orleans which is carrying busloads of children and Navy seamen on shore leave for Mardi Gras. (That is not a joke. Apparently they couldn't get a baseball team, your Mom, and apple pie trucks via general casting.) To catch perpetrator, the government uses some funky tech which allows them to see into the past. The trouble is that they can't choose when in the past to look; their view is always 4 days before now.

The many interesting things one could do with this premise are hinted at but are never developed. Regrettably the Get-the-bad-guy plot wins against the can-change-our-destiny theme.

It was fun enough and was mostly harmless. Stick in your Netflix queue.
