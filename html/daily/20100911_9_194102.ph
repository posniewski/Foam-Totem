You want to talk about something that NO ONE cares about: <a href="/future/index.html">The Orb of Hotep</a>. It's so old I don't even remember how old it is. The oldest time on the files there is 2007, but I think that's when I rebuilt the Totem.

Anyway, I noticed that my server logs were getting large for no reason, and it seemed like the Orb was popular. It was very popular... with spambots. Anyway, I cleaned it up and took advantage of the situation to learn how to add a CAPTCHA to a web page. It's really easy, actually, especially with <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha">reCAPTCHA</a>.

Google does the actual heavy lifting: providing images, the captcha widget, and verifiction as server requests. A <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Captcha-reCAPTCHA/lib/Captcha/reCAPTCHA.pm">perl module</a> simplifies making the server requests. Piece of cake.
