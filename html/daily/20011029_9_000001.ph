Media update Part 2: The Television Sequel.

<a href="http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_supersites/zim/"><i>Invader ZIM</i></a> [Nick]: See below for comments on the Halloween special. Stories are original and definitely not normal (or maybe even sane), characters are hysterical, and the animation is really good.

<a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/jack/"><i>Samauri Jack</i></a> [Cartoon Network]: This is just a great cartoon. It references everything from film to Hanna-Barbara cartoons to anime and does it all with in a brilliantly spartan style.

<a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/alias/home/indexcia.html"><i>Alias</i></a> [ABC]: Oh my goodness! I'm watching a spy show on network television and I like it! Ahhhh! Alias has good fights, a strong (but vulnerable, of course, and sassy in every hair color and style) female lead, and all sorts of intrigue. The pilot is fantastic and the episodes thus far have been nearly (though not quite) up to the pilot.

<a href="http://www.mutantx.net/homepage.html"><i>Mutant-X</i></a> [syndicated - WB near me]: This show is terrible. It's not even so-bad-it's-good. It's simply bad. Avoid it.
